https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,We are vegetarians and ordered a vegetarian dish but found chunks of beef in it.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,"Good food but I wish there were options to leave notes to the cook staff in the app. I have allergies and wanted to let them know, so I had to call on the phone."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,The driver did not ring the bell at the time of dropping the food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,It was late. I need compensation

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Food was good but was slow to prepare this time.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,The burrito was 75% rice and hardly anything else
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Missing cheese on both burritos and guacamole was not evenly distributed.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,"I paid extra for guacamole, but they substituted lettuce without indicating so"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Well made burrito.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Already reported the fact that I never received notification my food was ready. I got cold food because of that.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,"My food was super cold , the bag seal was broken . I didn’t really feel safe eating the food because it seemed like the maybe the food was tampered with"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Food arrived cold and was delayed
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Hardly had any chicken in my bowl…

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Portion was small and inadequate
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Driver never delivered food! I tried to contact them but they didn’t respond.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Burrito was tiny.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,I enjoy the restaurant but I received the wrong order which really bummed me out.   This is my first time having this problem with Chipotle.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,The serving size that they give is not enough. The food filled up about half of the bowl :(
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,It was great
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Burritos getting really small.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,The delivery was quite late. No use of grubhub*
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Give forks and napkins like I asked pls
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Did not get order correct.  It was not well put together and was ice cold
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,"They downsize, rob the customers that order online. I get probably on 60% of what I deserve based on what I'm paying. I got to chipotle often in a different city and this one is borderline criminal in the way they steal from the online orders. it takes me 10 bites from a normal burrito, it takes me 6 from the Davis location. They barely add any steak either, its super criminal. Im getting like 6 pieces of steak per tiny burrito. This is terrible"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Late order. Utensils not given despite instructions
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Wrong burrito was served
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Everything worked out accordingly thank you
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,The burrito has very little bacon and had no flavor.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Some of the best Mexican food in town!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Love this place
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"Overcooked carnitas, bland, and definitely not authentic compared to the taquerias I’ve been to. You usually can never go wrong with a burrito, but it was mostly a salad with sharp pieces of meat. Beans and rice were yummy tho. Also heard their breakfast burritos are bomb. Horchata was super sweet, but decent."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,The taco was messy but good. The plate was VERY good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Always provides great food for their orders!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"Customer service was great, unfortunately they got my order wrong"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Food was completely cold. Took a really long time to get my food. Doesn’t make sense with me living somewhat close to the restaurant.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"great food, wish their website was up and working so i wouldn't have to use an app to order"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"The meat is super dry and tastes old. I've never had anything like it. It literally tasted like stale jerky dipped in dirty oil. My delivery guy was great, though!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Overrated 2.5 stars foods
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Driver went to another address before delivery and took over 45 mins to deliver food from 15 mins away
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"Got the carne asada breakfast burrito which had almost no meat in it. Lacked seemingly any type of seasoning, and I got pico with it that also tastes like nothing. It was a very dry burrito that was not helped by the fact they forgot to put my 2 Verde sauces in the bag. One  positive thing I can say is the burrito was massive, which only made the pain of having no sauce worse."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"Great food great service, solid price point"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,There was one thing missing that I believe I have been reimbursed for.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,The food was awful. I never seen carnitas sliced. It was dry and tasted old.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,There was no meat on my carne asada taco salad. Disappointed
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Food is consistently great and workers are friendly
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,The foods quality has gone down
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,The restaurant was good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Our delivery driver arrived with our food HOT I was notified they were waiting and personally when they were on their way.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"Paid extra for sour cream and they didn’t include it in the order. As a result, burrito was super dry. I normally like this place, but is pretty middle of the road for Mexican, and if they can’t get the orders right, then it’s not worth it."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,Love this restaurant! It's delicious and affordable

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"Y'all. These burritos are HEFTY.

I added rice, beans, and veg which filled them out, but they're gigantic. I picked up the heavy bag off my porch and went ""oh damn"".

Tasty too! A+, would have leftovers again."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,I had a burrito and it was so good!!  And it wasn’t huge!!! Great quality shredded beef.  Thank you!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/oscars-very-mexican-food-3061-freeport-blvd-sacramento/6565584,"Greasy, heavy, overcooked, and flavorless. Yet... hours later, the grease burn flavor is still in my mouth. What happened, Oscar?"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,My kid loves it.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,Some of the chicken in the chicken platter was overcooked. The food was warm at best because they made it too early before the driver arrived to pick it up.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,2 items missing from my order
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,We love Falafel corner but they often forget to remove onions from the wraps when requested.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"I will still continue to order from here because you get a lot of good food and it is at a reasonable price. But, this is the second time I have ordered from them and they have messed up on the order. They should double check the order before bagging it."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"Good food, good price"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"The Greek salad was big for the price! Not a big fan of the dressing, though. Gyro was delicious!"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,The only issue I had was that the bag was open enough to have flies get in my food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,One of my favorite restaurants to order from!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,This was the best tasting falafel I have ever had before. I have ordered falafel from many restaurants in the past and this is the supreme falafel!— not to mention how remarkably tasty the gyros chicken and dolmas were
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"I will always order and eat from this restaurant. However, this is the first time I am giving it anything but a 5 star. Two things...some of the chicken still had cartilage on it, and the other is that the order came 16 minutes too early and we hadn't gotten home from work yet."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,Not the best location for this chain
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"The food was wonderful and flavor was good, the only thing that I was not a fan of was the fries, they seem to be under cooked, more soggy them crunchy. I would order again just no fires."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-1004-j-st-sacramento/5958720,Flavorful food with good sized portions. It came hot and not soggy.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-1004-j-st-sacramento/5958720,"The food was good overall, but driver drove around with my order for 15 mins, so food was pretty much cold when it arrived. I've had the same dish before and it's much better when it arrives hot."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-1004-j-st-sacramento/5958720,The bread was hard and dry

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,"Restaurant is excellent, delivery not so good"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,confusing grub hub menu. food wasn’t good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,No issues at all with the delivery. The shredded pork was very dry and barely any cheese. I haven’t ordered from here for a while due to a change in the quality. I thought it was a fluke but that does not seem to be the case.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,great job delivering
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,"Good food, needed plates and napkins as we're staying in a hotel.  Not sure how you could say that in the order"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,Good but forgot my cheese on my nachos
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,Food was good.  I called to request extra sauce.  Which I didn't receive any sauce also my order was missing some item's.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,They forgot some sauces otherwise it was fine
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,They forgot to include key ingredients (meat and beans) for one of the items (super nachos) I ordered. The burrito was a little salty as well.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,"I like it but prefer one where delivery isn't an option. But this one is good, not excellent but they are generous with their side of guacamole and pico."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/el-patio-fresh-mexican-grill-200-e-st-davis/1950144,The fries were very over cooked to the point of breaking the plastic fork and even having a hard time with my metal fork. Everything else was great but the burnt/overcooked fries kinda killed it :(

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/524-mexican-food-3830-northgate-blvd-sacramento/5620200,"This is probably the most bland Mexican food I’ve eaten.  Half of the dishes didn’t even look at salt… let alone typical Mexican spices.  I feel like I just wasted $100.  The hamburger I bought for my son was probably the best dish.   Please… find your cumin, cinnamon, s/p, etc.  Everything I ordered was so exceptionally tasteless."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,Driver left food on the ground outside the gate. Driver did not wait for me to come out. Would like to remove tip.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,This was the fish and chips I have ever had. The food was dry and had little a little bit of fish in all the batter. I will tell everyone save your money. It’s terrible!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,Food was delayed a couple times
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,"Wow, one of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,Loved it all combo’s Red Snapper fish
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,1st timer. Food was great.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,"I have not ate there since you changed managers. I ate there twice and was not happy with it. But I was wanted to try it again cause I used to enjoy it from time to time and it was very good. Still a tad different than it was with prior manager. But the French fries were a lot better different type. I don't like the crinkle kind that it used to be and the fish was a lot nicer. Bigger, but there's something different about the coating. It seemed to be  little harder or something. I don't know, but it was still excellent, but just not as good as it used To b"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,I was given old fish. The cod was ok but the cat fish was old. Had brown freezer burns on it  I was very disappointed 😞
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,Good fried fish. Sides not so much
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,"The code fish was delicious. Although the breading was a bit more than the fish itself. The frys were tasty, and the food arrived hot. Even though I requested utensils, they were not included."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,Fish is excellent! Sides not good and missing a side
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,Jumbo shrimp was teeeeeeny. Red beans and rice was terrible.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,"Not recommended for mobile orders. This restaurant will not contact you if they are out of items, and their substitution choices are terrible. I ordered the 2 combo basket, birthday cake slice, and strawberry shake. The shake was immediately refunded with no explanation - I'll assume they were out. Now, when I think of birthday cake, I think funfetti. I received chocolate cake, which I can see is a separate item on the menu. I don't eat chocolate, so this went in the trash. Then to the combo - the proteins (wings and catfish with lemon dust) were great. The sides, tho... Okra was good, but the Mac and cheese was inedible (wtf kind of cheese is that??), and the coleslaw is mid. If I had been counting on that cake and shake, my night would've been ruined. But the catfish was the goal, so there's that. Will not order delivery from here again, though."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/skips-fish--chicken--truxel-rd-3291-truxel-rd-sacramento/7603192,"Food was very good and hot however, one item was left out."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,Very good and fast
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,Usually their food is excellent but the ribs were dry and I had ordered 2 sides of fries since I had a full rack of ribs. I only received one small container of fries when on previous orders I received 2 small containers or one large container of fries. Very disappointing since this is my go too order at Chili's.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,Order was correct. Driver was quick and very polite. Girl deserves a raise. Hard to find good people.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,Love the restaurant and food. But the order was cold due to delivery being late.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,I received the complete wrong order and it was the fault of the driver. He did not check the name or delivery service. It was a DoorDash order!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,Good meal and good delivery.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,Steak  was a little red for medium well.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,"Chili’s did nothing wrong. The fault with this order lays squarely on Grub Hub and their appalling delivery. Driver speaks no English and couldn’t read the very detailed directions I gave to find  my condo. He drove aimlessly around for 25 minutes in my complex. I called him 3 times. Didn’t understand a word I said. Food was cold, in shambles, inedible when it finally arrived."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,The bun used for my burger was too small and soggy on the bottom

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,"The order was wrong. I received chicken strips instead of steak, regular fries instead of Texas fries. Everything I was up charged for didn’t arrive. Not satisfied with the resolution either."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chilis-3870-truxel-rd-sacramento/3323926,Food was thrown together and a mess I had fries in my order and asked for condiments but I didn't receive any!!!...food was cold by the time it arrived

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/five-guys-768-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/3344719,I have been a five guys fan forever bit today the fries were hard and the burger just not so good. I think being on the premises is better than traveling after being  prepared.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panera-bread-609-3rd-st-davis/2054645,Delivery part was great but it's ridiculous that Panera charges over $2 for a tiny little container of cream cheese that's not even enough for both sides of a single bagel.  Will not order again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panera-bread-609-3rd-st-davis/2054645,They packed the bread right next to the cold water bottle which made the bread soggy

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/i-heart-mac--cheese-1631-k-st-sacramento/7561296,"The mac and cheese was pretty good, the grilled cheese was soggy (perhaps not a good delivery item). I would have given a higher rating, but my order was also missing one of the sides."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/i-heart-mac--cheese-1631-k-st-sacramento/7561296,"The mac and cheese tasted like lately buttered, unseasoned pasta. Maybe it was tossed in something, but no sauce or cheese to be found. 

Ordered vegan grilled cheese and they called to tell me they didn't have vegan cheese slices and wanted to know if I wanted anything else. I asked them to remove the sandwhich but include a slice of toast. They agreed, and there were 2 slices of burnt toast completely saturated in salty butter, but they still charged me for the vegan grilled cheese + veggies I added to the original order. 

Tater tots were unsalvagable. Cooked, refrigerated, microwaved, and cold again. They were SO try and disgusting.  I had high hopes. I'm rooting for them to improve but it'd take a lot for me to try it again."

The descriptions were definitely very enticing and I expected incredible bursts of flavor for $14 a pint.  I must not have a refined, gourmet palate as all of you do, but I'll stick to Baskin Robbins. I like my desserts to taste like dessert, not an additional side dish. The snickerdoodle was mildly cinnamon-y and the cookies seemed to be undercooked. The strawberry tastes like olive oil - which would be fine if I was eating a salad."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"I forgot to change my address but it was all good! Grubhub notified the driver when I reached out for help and the driver texted me promptly to make sure he had the right apartment (thank you Scott!)

The driver even reached out to me after delivering that he noticed one of the Boba drinks had been placed in the bag upside down and told me that I could contact Grubhub if it leaked. Even though nothing leaked or was otherwise amiss, I was very touched by and appreciative of the driver's above and beyond kindness and service (again, thank you Scott!)

The food and drinks were perfect for a hot day like today, especially for someone like me who doesn't have a car and had absolutely zero motivation to cook.

Overall, 11/10! Super happy!

If possible, please pass my gratitude and appreciation to Scott for his stellar performance and amazing service on this hot summer day!"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"Did not receive an item ordered, instead was automatically refunded with no notification why it was removed from order. Couldn’t order something else since it closed soon after delivery."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Love Lazi Cow! And Grubhub was a great way to pre-order
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Funky. Good milk tea. Haven't tried the food yet. Next time.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"I went here specifically for the cool glass cups they give you, but when I got there the lady said they didn't put online orders in glass cups. I've made an online order before and got a glass cup, I was very disappointed because I also left a rather large tip."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"Delicious popcorn chicken, perfect drink orders. I was super pleased."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"The food is actually pretty decent, but for the first time I didn't get Boba with my green milk tea so that was sad. I've decided to order tapioca pearls online so I can make my own. 

This isn't the only restaurant that didn't put Boba in my tea. 
Teabo café is the worst!  They messed up my orders twice - once I ordered 3 teas with boba and they only delivered one. The other time they didn't put boba in my $7.20 tea but only refunded me $2.60. And they are rude and late with refunds. 

GrubHub customer service chat agents were not very helpful either. Apparently I have to wait up to 10 business days for a refund. 

I will still order from lazy cow because their food is good and this is the first mistake they made.  

But NOT Teabo. (I had to put this review here because I was never offered the chance to review my last two orders with Teabo.)"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"The food was fine, but the deliver was very late and the delivery person did not tell me when the food was dropped off so it sat outside in the rain for 15 min."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"Pretty good first time purchase, will order again! I was impressed that the ice cream was still frozen when it got here, the food was hot, and the green milk tea was delicious!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"Good food, not great service. The driver was nice, but my food was cold, spilling, and had no utensils."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,very flavorful and reasonably priced
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Lazi Cow is more expensive for tea than other places and quality not always stellar but i knew what i was getting when i ordered it
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"Delicious ice cream, the vegan banana ice cream was awesome"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Over an hour later than estimated
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Food was very good the teas were delicious and I love the cups they deliver the teas in
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"Lazi Cow is the best, but holy smokes was the driver service garbage. No hot bag, took 50 minutes to get here. The stacked deliveries may not be the drivers fault, but the lack of hot bags is. I still left 5 stars cause this restaurant is dope, but y'all may want to start requiring that pick-up drivers have a delivery bag. Cold potstickers just don't hit the same."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Received the wrong order- I was missing a part of my meal and it seemed unfinished
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"The food tasted great and it arrived early! The delivery driver was really nice. The only downside was the poor packaging of one of the items. The way they put the food into the container made it impossible to open the lid without the curry spilling out. Other than that, it was a good experience and I would order from here again!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,❤️ the concept
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,OH MY GOD HORRIBLE FOOD TODAY I COULD NOT EVEN EAT IT!!!!! The ramen was so salty omg the calamari was burned and who the heck makes these terrible smoothies. No flavor at all! Wow horrible!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Grubhub is trash
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"It wasn't the restaurant, it was the delivery guy. He came 20 minutes later than he was supposed to, and didn't even include utensils for us to use (fork, napkin). I'm very disappointed."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"Placed an order. Received a text saying my order was on the way 45 minutes later. 15 minutes later my food was marked delivered even though  I had no food. Tried calling the number provided only for the phone line to be busy 3 times. Contacted Grubhub support to be asked to wait 10 more minutes. Then contacted them again to be told i'd get a phone call from a manager. 2 hours later, still no food, still no phone call. Great service."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Placed my order at 3:40 it didn't arrive until 5:30. Had to leave at 5. Food is sitting at my door apparently. Will not be using grub hub again. Two hours is ridiculous. The driver took forever. It's my favorite restaraunt in davis. They have really good food. The delivery driver needs to go or there needs to be more grub hub drivers. Two hours is stupid.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Loved the reusable glass jars and the bubble tea was delicious!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cvs-1550-e-covell-blvd-davis/7270656,"It was CVS, so it was fine."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cvs-1550-e-covell-blvd-davis/7270656,"I didn’t get the black IPhone charger 🔌 which was $33.00 & nor did I get a replacement for the iPhone replacement ??? Again ; fully charged for the whole order but no credit nor did I receive a phone call from anyone that could have explained the problem ? My health condition will not permit me to keep contact CVS or grubhub ?

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/menchies-frozen-yogurt-3230-arena-blvd-sacramento/6039136,Love this place. Just wish they would mix the stuff up in the yogurt.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,My boyfriend said it was very good it was a present for him
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"My son's father said the chocolate chip cookie was a little dry. The tiramisu he had, had too much liquid, in the sponge. The chocolate caramel mousse tart, was too dry. And our son's opinion was he liked the chocolate cake and cookie. Overall it was okay but not the best."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"The devils food cake was dry but the portion is generous enough for two. At $6 each, the cookies were nothing to write home about. I wouldn’t order from here again considering the price to yumminess ratio."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"I thought because of the long line that the cake must be really good.  I stopped by after work to pick up a slice of German Chocolate and Red Velvet for my friend. I was so excited that I didn't even wait to get home, I tore open the bag in my car. Did somebody say cake fraud? Not close to what I expected after seeing such a long line and so many beautiful cakes. I wish I had just gone straight home instead. The red velvet slice was like like box cake, and the german chocolate slice was dry. The frosting was a winner. I ate the frosting and tossed the rest in the trash. The other slice is sitting on the counter, partially eaten. I'm so hurt."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"Order was significantly delayed. I had asked for driver to ring doorbell upon drop off. He did not. Worst yet, one of the items I ordered was missing."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Awesome driver!! Thanks so much!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,The cakes were nice and light. I was impressed.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"He was the best grub huh driver I ever had he should get paid double what others get paid, thank you so much!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Not sure why a $30 order got me such small slices (2 slices total) this time. It didn't happen with my previous order (nice big slices of the same type of cake). Buyer beware.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Rick’s Dessert Diner is awesome. Can’t understand why my order took almost an hour over my “initial” estimated time of arrival.  The Grubhub driver Dimitri seemed to be taking surface roads then back on the interstate like he was lost. Poor service from grubhub.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Fruit basket slice & napoleon 👌🏼 cheesecake slice… meh

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Have always loved Rick's Desserts!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,I am so glad that they had a gluten free menu. I got two different kinds of torte's. Serving size was enough for two. It was so delicious and decadent. I am so excited about this restaurant and my relationship.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,It was good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Dry cake honestly not sure why this open!? Like the crème brûlée wasn’t good either.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,The cake was frozen/thawed NO FLAVOR!!!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,The food was great just cold because of the traffic.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,The items were made of artificial ingredients.  Like cool whip instead of rich homemade whipped cream.  I threw the cheesecake away.  I knew it was made with fake whipped cream.  It didn’t even taste like cheesecake. The cream cheese was artificial too.  It was a waste of money.  Never go there AGAIN !!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,It's a good go-to when you're in the mood for desserts.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"Usually a great place for dessert, but received a slice of cake tonight that was small and runny. Absolutely not worth the price."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Everything is so sugary. I wish they would cut the sugar in half.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"Cake came sloppy and thrown in food container with no care, making the cake slices mushy. The sandwich we ordered warm came cold and also sloppy wrapped. I was missing a main item I ordered as well. Never ordering from here again. At least Grubhub made it right, it’s on the restaurant not on Grubhub that I had a poor experience."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Delicious option for desserts!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"I ordered a slice of oreo cheesecake and a slice of pumpkin pie. Instead of pie, I received cake. And the cheesecake was old."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Driver opened package and stole part of order  remainder of order was thrown out as order was tampered with and partially stolen
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"The sandwich was not really good, spices flavor to strong."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,The pecan pie was almost as good as grandma's. Making it the second best I have tasted. Good pecan pie is hard to find and I'm ecstatic I found it.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,The BEST tiramisu! Always a nice treat.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"Unfortunately, I did not receive the pie that I ordered and paid for through the nose. I received a slice of a different pie delivered to my door. Not happy at all. I ordered that pie. Specially, for my son. This place seems bizarre. That’s all I can say I hope I get my refund."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,The pepperoni in my sandwich was still wrapped in plastic casing. It is not a natural casing. Please check before eating.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Overpriced. The eclair was not as pictured & custard/cream not good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Service was great. Ricks dessert diner was skimpy on a 10$ piece of cake
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,"IVE ORDERED 3 TIMES AND EACH TIME WAS I CORRECT. HONESTLY THEY REALLY JUST DONT CARE IN THERE. SENDING IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEMS THAT I ASKED FOR, THEY TAKE FOREVER TO PREPARE THE ORDER AND WHEN YOU CALL THEM YIU JUST GET AN ANSWERING MACHINE WITH NO CALL BACK EVER. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME IR MONEY IM TELLING YOU!! DO A PICKUP ORDER IF YOU WANT TOUR DESERT CORRECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ricks-dessert-diner-2401-j-st-sacramento/5804736,Requested fork but did not receive had to eat pie with my hands. Im a gangster so i managed but would have rather had a fork.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cajun-feast-206-3rd-st-davis/2621120,Descriptions of food dishes were not accurate. Baked chicken was two small drumettes and a tiny half thigh. Not worth the money.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,The quality and quantity of the food was very good I would recommend it to others
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,Some items are not edible because of poor quality
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,They need to open earlier so that I don't eat so late
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,It wasn't what I thought it would be
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,I love the food. I will order again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,I cannot say because I received someone else's food from a different restaurant.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,It wasn't the best sushi.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Very good, larger than expected portion sizes"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Generally the food is normally decent quality and the price is good. However, in this most recent order, there was no wasabi in my order. Which I love and one of the main reasons I get sushi. I messaged the driver to see if maybe it had fallen out in his car, he responded and said “no” and when I asked him to please bring some, he ignored my message. That was very disappointing."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,Very good food. Fast delivery.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,affordable and food service
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Low quality, cheap sushi. Egg rolls had no filling! No brown rice option. It's a buffet restaurant and probably struggling in pandemic"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"It was good, servings were bigger than expected, which was a nice surprise!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,Amazing local mom and pop shop!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,It was just okay. The wait was long (after already waiting through grub hub) the food was put together really bad. The sushi fell apart as soon as I tried picking them up.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,There were bits of plastic wrap in my food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,Consistently excellent food and service.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"10/10 would recommend! Their menu has a bunch of sushi options, and their sushi is always delicious! I've ordered from them so many times that this time they sent along a free soda for me! It was a ""melon creamy soda"" from Japan, and it was also delicious!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"The sushi was really tasty and the delivery person, Kai, was excellent!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,Food was good but the order was missing a roll. Delivery is almost always later than originally stated.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,Food was very good!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,Very good and reasonably priced.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,Delivery was quick so the sushi was still good! I enjoyed it
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Good food for inexpensive sushi. Not the best sushi I’ve EVER had, but it hit the spot after a long time of not having sushi. I was hesitant to order any raw fish since the weather has been hot as of late, so the non-raw rolls were only what I was comfortable ordering."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Food was good, but they sent the order 30 minutes late."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Great food, and large portion sizes. The salmon is tasty!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Flavors were good but the food was cold and it took almost two hours from order to delivery.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Not authentic but absolutely slaps
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Food is amazing but I would say it’s super salty. The chicken soup is so salty and so was the birria fried rice.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Food was great. Everything was ready. Unfortunately, utensils weren't included although requested."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The food was very good. Fresh. Tasty.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Red88 is fantastic
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Seems fine.  The drive took 56 minutes to come 10 minutes though.  I even called and said he was going the wrong way, and it still took 20 minutes after that.  He went all over town first."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The restaurant is great. Just wish food had arrived in the proper time frame
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,We asked for noodles with bokchoy and without sprouts. We got the opposite.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Food is delicious as always
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Food was excellent!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Grubhub driver was very nice 🙃
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"We always get the chicken soup. Tonight we decided to add the potstickers. Everything tasted amazing, delivery was on time. Great customer service thank you."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"We ordered the chicken noodle soup tonight and it was amazing and our driver ""delivered."" It was on time and delicious."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Food was delayed. Took an hr and a half. Food portions were smaller from before. I understand things cost more but the prices of the food are already higher than usual so isnt that accounted for? If not, then i think prices should increase versus making portions smaller + increase in prices."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The food was good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"The food  was great! We always get the chicken noodle soup, the whole family loves it especially when we are a little under the weather. 5 stars 😀"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Very good although I wish they could profit more through grubhub
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Excellent food and good variety
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Great! Love the food

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,the food was great (asian style fries are amaaaaazing) and i'll def eat there again
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,gr8t food n drinks
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"The food was good, but it was a bummer that they forgot to put in the silverware and the driver didn't check...."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Think the noodles were a little greasy and not much chicken. The pig fries were good!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Good vegan options!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The potatoes were hard and the portions were small
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The driver was great. He called us about 10 minutes before our expected delivery time to tell us that the restaurant had yet to start our food. That part was pretty disappointing.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Absolute worst. The email says my order is delivered but it wasn't. There is no picture or text sent to me that the order was delivered. I tried to call Grubhub but they were having technical difficulty. I wasted my 17 dollars I even tipped the driver which I shouldn't have.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Food was Delicious and hot and ready when we arrived to pick it up! Crab Wontons are Yummy, would Recommend. Pot Stickers are on point. We also tried the, Spicy BBQ pork Ramen (if you get it as a noddle dish and not the ramen, it is good just doesnt pack as much flavor as expected), as well as the Red 88 Fried Rice, which was by far the best item we ordered. If your looking for a Asian Style meal in the area, Red 88 Noodle Bar Will not Disappoint."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Love it. Good variety of Asian-style cuisines, and unique amongst what's around"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Third time ordering from Red 88 - we love it!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,Always a great place to order when I am in Sacramento.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,"Great, but I was missing my utensils to eat the food."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,It was fun to get to eat vegan food that isn't traditionally vegan.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,Excellent service and food
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,Wish there was some chili oil or spicy sauce with the order. Did not finish the Hot & Sour soup. It had too much vinegar and smelled strange. Everything else was very good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,Delicious vegan food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,I love it

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,"Coconut curry tasted watered down and had no flavor 

Ham fried rice was good 

We asked for utensils and didn’t receive any. It would have been nice to have sauces as well to punch up some of the lacking flavors from the food."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,My favorite vegan restaurant.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,It very flavorful

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,Love it. One of my all time favorites.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,I was unable to eat the food because the request for utensils was missed (and I checked off the box).  Staying in a local hotel and I don't typically pack utensils in my luggage.  What a bust and lack of service.  Would not use Vegan Deadly Sins or Grubhub customer service assistance because that is a total waste of your time!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,I love that everything is vegan.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,It was delicious

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,"I hadcthe General Tao Chicken Tso Chicken,. and it was better than I expected."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,It is great that it has a gluten-free part of menu. I wish grub hub had a list of restaurants that have gluten free menu sections.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,Always love the complimentary sesame balls they give out
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,So good! Will definitely order from here again:
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,The only issue was the driver left my food on the ground and did not bother to ring the bell!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,"Good food, tasted great."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,Food was cold and unedible
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,They have great savory food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,"Food was excellent but when it was delivered, it was somewhat of a mess. We ordered sushi (obviously) but when we opened the packages, the food and sauces were all over the place. As if the food fell over."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,Got both vegetarian roll and they were alright. Wasn't a fan of the mushrooms on the farm to and some of my 24 carrot pieces were almost all rice.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,I love it
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,The food was terrible we couldn't eat it. Please refund.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,It's always great
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,"Really loved the unique sushi selection at WeDaShii! Our favorites were the veggie roll with garlic aioli, the rice-free roll and the Phili Roll. Also loved the quality and quantity of the vegetable tempura.  If you are a mushroom fan you will love the veggie tempura selection."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,Food was to be ready 7:25-7:35. Got there by 7:20 and was told it’d be 10 min. but ended up waiting 35 min. There were no updates from the staff.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,Good food fresh
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wedashii-1010-18th-st-sacramento/6146872,"The rolls were messy and falling apart, the presentation nor appealing and the Rolls were thrown everywhere"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Food wasn't good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Food wasn't good today
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Pretty good but the beef was frozen solid and I needed to microwave it
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,They forgot my extra egg roll but the food is so good I'll forgive them
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Good as usual!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Really good food
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Food was super yummy!! Best pho I’ve had in a while.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"The driver was late and the food was cold. The restaurant was one time. But the driver seemed to spend an awful lot of time in Davis in one area, which gives the impression of him picking up another order."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,I found a short hair in the soup.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"Classic pho, broth is rich and delicious. Delivery was smooth and fast."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"Love pho, their broth is so good."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Everything was good except the fried chicken wings on the appetizer menu. They were overcooked to the point where they were very hard and super crispy and dried out all the way to the bone. I will try this restaurant again just not the chicken wings.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"Good stuff, as usual."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"Delicious, but food was barely warm still. It was soup."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Wait way too long
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Good food that's reasonably priced :)
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Food was pretty tasty although the meat is a little bit overcooked and dry. They also forgot to include the extra eggroll I ordered.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,It was very good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-tasty-301-g-st-davis/7443272,Always has great food !
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-tasty-301-g-st-davis/7443272,Good but sometimes they skimp on the greenery

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jacks-urban-eats-1321-w-covell-blvd-davis/2127430,There was no chicken and the chicken salad I ordered

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,"Good stuff. First time ordering, will order again! Baclava was delicious. Food reasonably priced, too."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,Food has water spilt on it and food itself was bitter even though it was French fries
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,Incorrect order and did not supply utensils as requested. But the food is tasty
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,"I process the food orders for my company and Halal Bros is definitely a fan favorite! We have ordered from them multiple times (15 - 20 people worth) and have been happy every time! 

The last time we had ordered through GrubHub and for some reason weren't given the option for delivery at 11:30 AM. Luckily one of the owners of Halal Bros called us to offer delivery at no extra cost! They are so generous and really make sure to go above and beyond for their people.

Highly recommend!"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,Fries were soggy when I asked for them to be well done. Food portions were small
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,Food was good.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,Ordered extra meat for 5.99 and didn’t get it . But meal was okay.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,Food was great. Great portions as well.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,Food is good. I received a notification my order was delayed but it was only about 20 minutes

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,My daughter wanted to eat something other than pizza or hamburgers so we ordered from here. It’s my very first time eating here and I will say the chicken gyros are amazing! Only flaw with the food delivery is the food packaging and the bag felt slightly greasy?? Maybe the fries bag touched the other items … didn’t like to have to  keep cleaning my hands as I took out each food item.. other than that? Food is excellent! Def will be ordering again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,"The quantity is average, and the taste is very mediocre. Perhaps a McDonald's burger has more taste than the mix platter that I ordered. Definitely won't order again."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/halal-bros-2917-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/2548274,"Great taste, great portions, great prices."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/nami-sushi-2880-5th-st-davis/8928272,Food was so good. Fresh and handled with care.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/nami-sushi-2880-5th-st-davis/8928272,I would order from restaurant again when I'm in the area
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,"Everything was great, and excellent GrubHub service."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,"We payed for a breadbowl, but instead got a papercup bowl."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Got my item wrong
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,It was a very good salami sandwich the only problem is I ordered a Cracked Pepper turkey sandwich. A credit would be fine but either way it was a good sandwich just not the right sandwich.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Order was missing sides.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,"I really wanted cookies, but they always seem to forget them 😔"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Completely wrong order.  The sandwich ended up going into the garbage.  I didn’t order the vegetable soup but it was ok and probably healthier than the Mac and cheese we did order.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Food arrived cold.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Always been good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,"Day old bread for sure, not close to fresh, hurt my mouth to eat."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,The sandwich was small
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Driget first I ordered the crunchy chicken and it did not come they said canceled all of a sudden because it was closed why would you advertise it when it was closed I don't get it then I ordered sourdough and it said it was closed but then it when I went to get the Burger King at the door and sourdough delivered right there on Georgetown with all the dirt and everything just sitting at my door dogs were outside and everything then I ordered Burger King I don't know how I ordered two orders but I only wanted one order family bundle thank you for your attention and thank you for the delivery cuz I was starving it's crazy because first order didn't come then the second order said it wasn't coming and it was there and set an order was two orders wow what an experience for the night starving
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Never will order again. Paid extra for Hard as a rock avocado. Shameful.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,They frequently get the order wrong
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,That was the smallest sandwich ever. Also very bland
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,TOTALLY REDEEMED! Thank you for having the only place in town I can get some Potato Soup. (bonus points b/c they remembered me from last time)
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,The entire reason I eat here on Wednesdays is because of the Potato soup. They run out of potato soup early so I just end up getting my sandwich or going some place else. I'm tried of rolling the dice on this place.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Great food and service
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,I love the food

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,so damn good..
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,The sandwich was plain and not worth the cost. I ordered a few hours ahead of time so that my food would arrive on time and it was over half an hour late. The driver wasn't friendly
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Overpriced. Not even close to what a Rueben sandwich should be. Small portions for price
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,It's was not worth my money
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Easy to order. Quick service. Food was delicious. Will order again!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,My tuna melt was hella watery like the person making the sandwich slopped the tuna on the sandwich without draining the watery stuff
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,gave me the wrong restaurant. but the food was really good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,"As I just described, my order did not include cheese an the dressings on the side for both sandwiches as was requested"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,They forgot one of the salads we ordered
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,"I ordered an item on the menu: a pastrami and Turkey sub, but requested no Turkey, but extra pastrami.  I got turkey and pastrami."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,I ordered chips with the sandwich and only received the sandwich.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,They did not give me my 3 bags of chips
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,"Tasty, fresh food"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone--life-505-l-st-davis/2856353,"Always had problems with getting extra(paid for) dipping sauce. So didn't bother this time. Turns out I didn't need it because they substantially shrunk the size of the calzone. Plus, it was cold and undercooked. Won't order from them again."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone--life-505-l-st-davis/2856353,"Calzone was good, missed the extra sauces.  No napkins provided."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone--life-505-l-st-davis/2856353,"Missing extra (paid for) sauce, cold, and late."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone--life-505-l-st-davis/2856353,Wrong order was givin to me and the delivery person never notified me when it was delivered

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,Some of the chicken in the chicken platter was overcooked. The food was warm at best because they made it too early before the driver arrived to pick it up.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,2 items missing from my order
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,We love Falafel corner but they often forget to remove onions from the wraps when requested.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"I will still continue to order from here because you get a lot of good food and it is at a reasonable price. But, this is the second time I have ordered from them and they have messed up on the order. They should double check the order before bagging it."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"Good food, good price"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"The Greek salad was big for the price! Not a big fan of the dressing, though. Gyro was delicious!"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,The only issue I had was that the bag was open enough to have flies get in my food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,One of my favorite restaurants to order from!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,This was the best tasting falafel I have ever had before. I have ordered falafel from many restaurants in the past and this is the supreme falafel!— not to mention how remarkably tasty the gyros chicken and dolmas were
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"I will always order and eat from this restaurant. However, this is the first time I am giving it anything but a 5 star. Two things...some of the chicken still had cartilage on it, and the other is that the order came 16 minutes too early and we hadn't gotten home from work yet."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,Just really good food.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,Not the best location for this chain
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-3620-n-freeway-blvd-sacramento/346705,"The food was wonderful and flavor was good, the only thing that I was not a fan of was the fries, they seem to be under cooked, more soggy them crunchy. I would order again just no fires."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wayback-burgers-1351-w-covell-blvd-davis/10283368,I would go back for sure.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Food wasn't good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Food wasn't good today
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Pretty good but the beef was frozen solid and I needed to microwave it
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,They forgot my extra egg roll but the food is so good I'll forgive them
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Good as usual!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Really good food
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Food was super yummy!! Best pho I’ve had in a while.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"The driver was late and the food was cold. The restaurant was one time. But the driver seemed to spend an awful lot of time in Davis in one area, which gives the impression of him picking up another order."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,I found a short hair in the soup.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"Classic pho, broth is rich and delicious. Delivery was smooth and fast."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"Love pho, their broth is so good."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Everything was good except the fried chicken wings on the appetizer menu. They were overcooked to the point where they were very hard and super crispy and dried out all the way to the bone. I will try this restaurant again just not the chicken wings.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"Good stuff, as usual."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,"Delicious, but food was barely warm still. It was soup."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Wait way too long
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Good food that's reasonably priced :)
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,Food was pretty tasty although the meat is a little bit overcooked and dry. They also forgot to include the extra eggroll I ordered.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-king-4-226-3rd-st-davis/5683000,It was very good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-davis-720-2nd-st-davis/6428896,Amazing food and great workers.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/falafel-corner-davis-720-2nd-st-davis/6428896,"Service and food are always excellent. We keep introducing friends to this establishment.

It’s my very first time eating here and I will say the chicken gyros are amazing! Only flaw with the food delivery is the food packaging and the bag felt slightly greasy??

Two small overcooked pieces of salmon on white rice and stir fried veggies for $22.  Lots of chewy ""steak"" in the teriyaki steak bowl.  Pot stickers were soggy and the dipping sauce was too spicy for us.  Should have read the reviews."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/teriyaki-madness-289-3rd-st-west-sacramento/4976816,"Only poor part of the experience is lack of parking. Food was excellent, service was friendly."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/teriyaki-madness-289-3rd-st-west-sacramento/4976816,portion size was small for the price
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/teriyaki-madness-289-3rd-st-west-sacramento/4976816,"Chicken was over cooked. Sauce on chicken when there wasn't supposed to be any. No utensils or napkins, when it was requested"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/teriyaki-madness-289-3rd-st-west-sacramento/4976816,"I was trying this restaurant for a change from the usual Japanese restaurant I that I order from. I ordered a extra hot Orange chicken, and it was not hot at all, but was rather bland. I think I'll go back to the usual, known Japanese restaurants!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/teriyaki-madness-289-3rd-st-west-sacramento/4976816,the sauce overwhelmed the dish itself . too much sauce
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/teriyaki-madness-289-3rd-st-west-sacramento/4976816,The meal was good but the chicken cuts could have been cleaner. Inhad to eat around fat and etc
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/teriyaki-madness-289-3rd-st-west-sacramento/4976816,Rice was undercooked. When half the meal is rice kinda gotta get that right. No crunchy rice.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/teriyaki-madness-289-3rd-st-west-sacramento/4976816,The restaurant may have been great but the food was ice cold by the time we got it after waiting an hour and 20 minutes.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panda-express-1491-w-covell-blvd-davis/1958456,"This driver must be doing more than one delivery service at a time as my food arrived 40 mins after the scheduled time. The restaurant o order from was less than two miles away. When I received it my sprite was room temperature and my food was no longer hot or crispy. Not mad at Panda Express, I’m annoyed with the driver."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panda-express-1491-w-covell-blvd-davis/1958456,Its like the food amount comes out if their own paycheck. I had about 3 pieces of neat from each of my entrees and about a handful of chowmein for 15 dollars. Rip off never order from this place
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panda-express-1491-w-covell-blvd-davis/1958456,"Again, my order from Grubhub was VERY late. The food was fine, but I was told it would arrive by 7:09pm, then 7:32, then 7:41. Disappointing waiting an hour for food from a restaurant that's a mile away. And it wasn't hot, just warm."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panda-express-1491-w-covell-blvd-davis/1958456,Standard Panda Express fare. Pretty good value and decent food. Thumbs up 👍
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panda-express-1491-w-covell-blvd-davis/1958456,The order was missing half of one meal but that wasn't the drivers fault.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panda-express-1491-w-covell-blvd-davis/1958456,"Generally I have no problems with this restaurant, but they did get one entree in my bigger plate wrong. Not a huge deal since it was the same price as what I ordered, I like what I got instead, and it was nice to do something different than my usual. Just a smidge disappointed since it wasn’t what I was expecting.

Delivery was quick and on-time though! No issues with the delivery at all"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panda-express-1491-w-covell-blvd-davis/1958456,"They dont keep their food delivery apps updated - so your choices are more limited than what u can get in the store. They say they’ll fix it, but they don’t. They got my order wrong. They rarely answer the phone."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,I enjoy the restaurant but I received the wrong order which really bummed me out.   This is my first time having this problem with Chipotle.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,The serving size that they give is not enough. The food filled up about half of the bowl :(

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,"They downsize, rob the customers that order online. I get probably on 60% of what I deserve based on what I'm paying. I got to chipotle often in a different city and this one is borderline criminal in the way they steal from the online orders. it takes me 10 bites from a normal burrito, it takes me 6 from the Davis location. They barely add any steak either, its super criminal. Im getting like 6 pieces of steak per tiny burrito. This is terrible"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chipotle-227-e-st-davis/2125568,Late order. Utensils not given despite instructions

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,Possibly the most bland tacos I have had in California. Ordered 4 different kinds and they might as well had been all the same with the lack of flavor. Was missing an item. And the salsa that came on side was enchilada sauce?   Or is the salsa also that bland? Overall very disappointing.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,I had the super nachos so delicious and my girlfriend had enchiladas and she loved it.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,"No utensils were included.  Chile Ellen was cold, not stuffed and so tough it was inedible."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,It's not about the restaurant but late delivery of cold food
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,"Both of our burritos were really messy, so much that they needed to double wrap them in foil. Also was disappointed by the pastor which looked and tasted more like ground pork with red chili flakes. Overall food was decent."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,"They are usually good but this time the potatos were rock hard in my burrito, i dont even know if they were potatos. Food was also unreasonably cold whennit arrived."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,"Gave it a 3 because GrubHub was over 30 minutes late. Surprisingly, the food was still hot and tasty! So not the restaurant's fault. I'll change the rating to 5 if I can ..."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,Only issue is the avocado was missing
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,"I asked the restaurant for extra lemon on both entree orders and only received 3 wedges total, which do not even add up to 1 full lime."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,Guac was spoiled. Food was assembled in a messy fashion.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,No chips? :(
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,The restaurant was great but the delivery took 1 1/2 hours
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,Tacos are dry and no side items like carrots etc when requested. Only one salsa for all of my items. Fish tacos are not that good also.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/taqueria-el-burrito-2-223-f-st-davis/2038919,"The restaurant was good, however the grub hub driver was too slow and the cold got cold"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Got my item wrong
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,It was a very good salami sandwich the only problem is I ordered a Cracked Pepper turkey sandwich. A credit would be fine but either way it was a good sandwich just not the right sandwich.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,"I really wanted cookies, but they always seem to forget them 😔"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Completely wrong order.  The sandwich ended up going into the garbage.  I didn’t order the vegetable soup but it was ok and probably healthier than the Mac and cheese we did order.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Food arrived cold.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,The entire reason I eat here on Wednesdays is because of the Potato soup. They run out of potato soup early so I just end up getting my sandwich or going some place else. I'm tried of rolling the dice on this place.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sourdough--co-401-i-st-sacramento/2614594,Great food and service

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kathmandu-kitchen-234-g-st-davis/271817,Delivery was not made by a GrubHub driver. So No way to track it. Then the driver got lost and we had to go out and find him.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kathmandu-kitchen-234-g-st-davis/271817,"The chicken pakora had less than half the usual amount and I don't know why. The rest of the food is in proper proportion and is as high quality as usual, but it was also half an hour late."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kathmandu-kitchen-234-g-st-davis/271817,"The food was amazing! Good portions, prepared exactly as I asked, absolutely delicious!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kathmandu-kitchen-234-g-st-davis/271817,I ordered from GrubHub at about 7:10pm and food was supposed to be delivered no later than 7:45pm.  It is now 8:25pm and not only has our order not been delivered but Grubhub's app says the restaurant is closed.  I want my money back.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kathmandu-kitchen-234-g-st-davis/271817,"We ordered our food at 4 PM and our food came around 5:30 PM

You say you have guaranteed delivery but you don't 

you say you can track but you can't

If I were to call the restaurant and order the food without going through GrubHub it would be about $70 but we went through GrubHub and it was an additional $40 ($110). I thought I would try it because I wanted to make sure our food arrived on time so that we can meet all of our events and activities that we were trying to do tonight but got the runaround and I'm really disappointed because I was counting on your service

You should state upfront whether tracking is available for a restaurant that you select. I felt like it was the bait and switch. 

I would appreciate it if you would refund everything."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kathmandu-kitchen-234-g-st-davis/271817,"Disappointed. The meal has been better in the past, and had more sides included. In the last order, the website included sides that were not delivered, but the site since updated with a reduction of items at the same price."

(sent with Gentle Effect)"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kathmandu-kitchen-234-g-st-davis/271817,"Food was overall fine, but the chicken tikka masala tasted more like a tomato bisque, and the garlic naan and basil and surprisingly little flavor."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kathmandu-kitchen-234-g-st-davis/271817,It's always fresh always good no complaints but I wish they served more rice with the chicken curry always end up with alot more curry left lol but to be fair it's probably me because it's like that every Indian restaurant and this place is the best!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/five-guys-768-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/3344719,I have been a five guys fan forever bit today the fries were hard and the burger just not so good. I think being on the premises is better than traveling after being  prepared.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/thai-canteen-1501-16th-st-sacramento/550106,I was given chicken instead of tofu and had to reorder. And even with a refund that doesn't cover the extra fees and tipping the driver so very frustrating
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/thai-canteen-1501-16th-st-sacramento/550106,"Food excellent, as always, however one area of improvement that's needed is order details.  For example, a coworker and I ordered the same item, but one of us ordered spicy and the other ordered no spice.  We received the items, but neither are marked,  and the receipt stapled to the bag of food does not show that one was supposed to by spicy and the other not spicy.   

I don't know if this is a problem or communication from GrubHub to the restaurant or if the 
restaurant's system is unable to capture order details,  or if we're dealing with a worker at the restaurant that ignored order details.  Overall, not a huge deal, but hopefully it's something that Thai Canteen will look into."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bangkok-12-thai-restaurant-900-12th-st-sacramento/2066622,"Pumpkin curry was the best- full of pumpkin pieces and chef did not skimp on chicken and shrimps. My only complaint was the Papaya salad and Fried Calamari appetizer. Salad was very bland and had no spice level to it.  I usually like crushed peanuts in salad, but this one had none.  The flavor was sweeter rather than spicy and tangy as it was described on menu. The calamari was a bit chewy, and the batter wasn't even salted. How come the restaurant assumes you will dip in sweet chili sauce, but I like eating mine without sauce, so batter should at least be salted and flavored? At best, it is mediocre Thai food. Debating whether to try it again."

I ordered a large portion of wonton soup & I was excited when it arrived..I also got egg rolls..I ordered a sprite & they sent Coca Cola, but that was ok..
The egg rolls were good.
I have been eating wonton soup my entire life & I am 70 years old..
I hate to say it, but that soup was the worst thing I have ever had. I'm not sure what kind of meat was in it...I took one bite & dumped the rest down the disposal..I almost cried because I was so hungry; not to mention that I spent $42 & tipped the driver $10:"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,It wasn't the best sushi.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Very good, larger than expected portion sizes"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Generally the food is normally decent quality and the price is good. However, in this most recent order, there was no wasabi in my order. Which I love and one of the main reasons I get sushi. I messaged the driver to see if maybe it had fallen out in his car, he responded and said “no” and when I asked him to please bring some, he ignored my message. That was very disappointing."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/davis-sushi-restaurant-1260-lake-blvd-unit-103-davis/553901,"Good food for inexpensive sushi. Not the best sushi I’ve EVER had, but it hit the spot after a long time of not having sushi. I was hesitant to order any raw fish since the weather has been hot as of late, so the non-raw rolls were only what I was comfortable ordering."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"Fair prices, super tasty, good portion sizes"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Delicious and great portion size
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Forgot the sauce for crab Rangoon.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"I got some yellow curry and it was got awful. How do you mess up something as simple? Couldn’t even remember to bring the rice on the side. Got some coconut shrimp as well and they were not even Cisco or US foods grade. Seem like something you would’ve just got from the dollar tree. I will say the driver got here pretty quick. He was nice enough and it’s just to take a picture with the delivery to verify it was dropped off. kudos to him for getting it here, but this restaurant is a hot dumpster fire. Complete garbage."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"The food was not fresh, and just was not good."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"Food is good, drunken noodles were a bit greasy though"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"Since it was late, all the noodles were stuck together and no longer moist. I ended up having to cook the food and add some ingredients to make it eatable"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Will try again
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,The portions sizes are small. The food is okay. Not terrible but just okay.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Food wasn’t good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Usually really good curry but the last order was a little off.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Food was too oily.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Great but no utensils
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Did not include utensils but food was good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,I would not recommend or use again

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Very good Thai food and nicely sized portions!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"The food was too small and over price for what I got
I pay two dollars extra to have beef I got four pieces of meat and more fried tofu.
I requested very hot pad. Thai just under Thai hot. It was very uneven and not that hot as far as I was concerned. .. overall the taste was adequate and I would give them a try again, because maybe the chef or owner was having an off day"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,The driver delivers to next door house same apt number but I retrieved it right away
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"Pad Thai and fried rice was decent, but the won ton soup,& the mango with sticky rice was terrible. Wanted to try this restaurant as it had more protein options, but will not order again"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"Chicken satay was completely dry like jerky, drunken noodle was overly soggy. I’ve had good food from here before, but this was a let down"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,No utensils and I'm staying in a hotel
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"Sticky rice was a rolled up wad and overcooked. 
Thai lettuce wraps were not what I expected. 
Panko green beans were overcooked. 
Red curry looked more like yellow curry. 
Seriously 1/2 of my order was blah and just tossed."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Thank you for bagging.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"The driver ghosted and the food sat at the restaurant. GH is screwing over restaurants and customers when they keep drivers that don’t pick up orders that are made by restaurants. It’s a waste of food and time. Fix it, Grub Hub."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,The food was blind. It wasn't very hot and they did not include utensils so that I could eat it or a straw to drink
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Usually great! It was like last night was an off night for them. Too bad but I will still try their food again
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,The mango rice was horrible. It was more like rice soup with canned mangoes. Drunken noodles was decent.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"Order was late but due to restaurant error, not the fault of the driver."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,"Appetizers had a stale taste,  main dish was great as was dessert, tho the mango was not quite ripe"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,I love this place.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,The food was awful
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Always good food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/orchid-thai-restaurant--bar-1609-16th-st-sacramento/545327,Peanut sauce tasted like maple syrup. Sweet chili sauce had no flavor.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fanny-anns-saloon-1023-2nd-street-sacramento/8396640,"They did not provide the two salads that we ordered, so our dinner is not complete, and I have to go buy the food elsewhere, eliminating the point have having food delivered at all"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fanny-anns-saloon-1023-2nd-street-sacramento/8396640,"The burger was a bit disappointing. Not very tasty,  very soggy from no ventilation in the packaging, and the burger juice was everywhere."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,Good portion sizes
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,Food was great. I had received an offer to connect my amazon prime with my grubhub and it said i would get delivery free but i was charged but that is a grubhub thing
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,This restaurant is awful. The worst one yet on Grubhub. I will be taking up issue with every single item.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,"It was good, I enjoyed it"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,Bad over cooked falafel
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,"Chicken skewers are over salted and dry. Falafel doesn’t seem to be freshly in-house made, oily and stale. Small portions. Not ordering again"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,The chicken didn’t  taste fresh like it’s the chicken precooked and grilled in the bag but then seasoned with Mediterranean spices.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,"Good food, love the chicken platter"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,Delicious food and it arrived hot even though I live 20+ minutes away.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/kings-halal-mediterranean-food-906-j-st-sacramento/5754672,"Loved the food, the people there, easy parking"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bruxie-500-1st-street-davis/7933384,Bruxies food is delicious
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Flavors were good but the food was cold and it took almost two hours from order to delivery.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Not authentic but absolutely slaps
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Food is amazing but I would say it’s super salty. The chicken soup is so salty and so was the birria fried rice.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Food was great. Everything was ready. Unfortunately, utensils weren't included although requested."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Red88 is fantastic
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Seems fine.  The drive took 56 minutes to come 10 minutes though.  I even called and said he was going the wrong way, and it still took 20 minutes after that.  He went all over town first."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The restaurant is great. Just wish food had arrived in the proper time frame
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,We asked for noodles with bokchoy and without sprouts. We got the opposite.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Food is delicious as always
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Food was excellent!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,It just took over an hour to get my food which was a bummer

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"We always get the chicken soup. Tonight we decided to add the potstickers. Everything tasted amazing, delivery was on time. Great customer service thank you."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"We ordered the chicken noodle soup tonight and it was amazing and our driver ""delivered."" It was on time and delicious."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Food was delayed. Took an hr and a half. Food portions were smaller from before. I understand things cost more but the prices of the food are already higher than usual so isnt that accounted for? If not, then i think prices should increase versus making portions smaller + increase in prices."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The food was good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"The food  was great! We always get the chicken noodle soup, the whole family loves it especially when we are a little under the weather. 5 stars 😀"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Very good although I wish they could profit more through grubhub
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Excellent food and good variety
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Great! Love the food

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,the food was great (asian style fries are amaaaaazing) and i'll def eat there again
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,gr8t food n drinks
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"The food was good, but it was a bummer that they forgot to put in the silverware and the driver didn't check...."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Think the noodles were a little greasy and not much chicken. The pig fries were good!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Good vegan options!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The potatoes were hard and the portions were small
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,The driver was great. He called us about 10 minutes before our expected delivery time to tell us that the restaurant had yet to start our food. That part was pretty disappointing.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Absolute worst. The email says my order is delivered but it wasn't. There is no picture or text sent to me that the order was delivered. I tried to call Grubhub but they were having technical difficulty. I wasted my 17 dollars I even tipped the driver which I shouldn't have.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Food was Delicious and hot and ready when we arrived to pick it up! Crab Wontons are Yummy, would Recommend. Pot Stickers are on point. We also tried the, Spicy BBQ pork Ramen (if you get it as a noddle dish and not the ramen, it is good just doesnt pack as much flavor as expected), as well as the Red 88 Fried Rice, which was by far the best item we ordered. If your looking for a Asian Style meal in the area, Red 88 Noodle Bar Will not Disappoint."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,"Love it. Good variety of Asian-style cuisines, and unique amongst what's around"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/red-88-noodle-bar-223-g-st-davis/1962093,Third time ordering from Red 88 - we love it!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Food was high quality. Would order again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,"My sushi looked like it had rolled around in the box the whole car ride, sauce everywhere. I didn't get a spoon for my miso soup. And the delivery person tried to drop off my food at the wrong restaurant."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Very good food!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,It's one of my favorites.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,I get the rolls were fried but it sits in a bit of oil. The fried wontons and sweet and sour sauce were DID NOT TASTE GOOD AT ALL!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,The food was very good. I think their packaging could be more secure so that it is somewhat tamper proof.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,"Faster than estimated, and right at my front door. Thank you!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,"Chicken was hard, not fresh meat."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,"Asked driver to ring the doorbell. He didn't. IT WAS RAINING. I don't have much of a roof over my porch, so the food was cold and some ruined. I tipped very generously too."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Quality sushi rolls and chicken wings
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,It is very good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,The fish wasn't fresh. The meat wasn't cooked enough. Disgusting.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,First time. Service was good. Food was good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,The sushi was mediocre and the SacTown roll had a funny taste.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Great food will definitely order again
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Love JenSai! Always fresh and hot

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,First time ever ordering from them. Icordered two sushi rolls. One was fantastic and the other was good. Just a personal preference.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Always fresh and delicious
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Good value. Spicy isnt spicy.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,"Wish the delivery came with chop sticks and soy sauce. As for the sushi, it’s just okay."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,"Fresh fish! Love our salmon sake sashimi, and salmon skin rolls the most! Delicious and put-together so well!!!  Would order from Jensai Sushi again!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,I would order from them again.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Good grief I already told you they didn't send all the food!  What do you think my thoughts are?!?
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Food was perfect and delicious as always.  Driver delivered to the wrong house.  I retrieved it from my neighbor.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,"Cmon, food was good but no soy sauce or chopsticks!! Not cool!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,The food was fresh and the portions were good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,I love Jensai! They're the best Japanese restaurant and so glad Grubhub offers services with them
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Really excellent sushi! My partner and I look forward to diving there eventually instead of always doing takeout.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Very expensive and the food was just alright. I know my sushi and I wouldn’t order from here again. Not very flavorful.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Grubhub delivers (pun intended) never had a bad experience with these guys
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,"Love jensai sushi and love to have it when I can't make it into the restaurant the food is awesome ,delicious and they always get my extra requests correct. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍👍"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jensai-sushi-2210-16th-st-sacramento/425422,Decent food. Fish was fresh. Spicy tuna wasn’t very spicy.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,Had fire for the first time recently. Ordered it again for myself the night after. Worth.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,"I always love fire wings! Great wings, probably best in area. I get Peking always and try a different flavor. Most are good not a fan of some rubs"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,We love the food
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,Very late but otherwise delicious
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,Fries were extremely cold and soggy
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,Good food as usual
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,Fires are stale not one fry in my order was soft or any good. Wings are small but okay.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,Wings were good but I got all flats which was kind of a bummer.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,On the driver: I live in a big apartment complex. Each apartment is accessible from the outside. I left specific instructions for how to find my apartment in the delivery notes. My driver left my food about a half block from my apartment. He lied and said there was no where to park. I have literally never had a driver not even bother to deliver my food to me before. Unacceptable.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,The food was good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/fire-wings-640-w-covell-blvd-davis/5451984,Yummy!  Love Fire Wings and delivery. Thanks.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/koja-kitchen-sac-732-k-st-sacramento/2039191,"Food was soggy, they didn't follow any of my instructions and my food was late, on top of all that all my beverages were missing from my order. Two thumbs way down!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/koja-kitchen-sac-732-k-st-sacramento/2039191,They attached the straw to a piece of gum and stuck it to the floor.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/koja-kitchen-sac-732-k-st-sacramento/2039191,"Hey this place has great food, I eat here a lot but it's pricy.. And it looks like they took away the Koja combo so you have to buy a side for it which comes out to be more."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/koja-kitchen-sac-732-k-st-sacramento/2039191,"The food was not worth the wait or money. First off, they charged me for an extra dish that I has to toss. The tofu and rice was so fried and overcooked, I hurt my teeth chewing on it, I just threw away. Really gross, like old tofu or rice. The tacos were not good, horrible flavor. Will not be ordering from here again."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/koja-kitchen-sac-732-k-st-sacramento/2039191,"This restaurant needs to update their item descriptions. I ordered the beef bun burger with egg. Neither the picture of the item nor the description says that there is spicy red sauce on this. I've never ordered from here before. I'm allergic to spicy stuff, and this looked safe. It arrived with one side covered in that sauce."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/koja-kitchen-sac-732-k-st-sacramento/2039191,Crispy chicken sandwich was missing all the condiments it was supposed to have. Just dry bread and dry chicken.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/koja-kitchen-sac-732-k-st-sacramento/2039191,The food is great. Only complaint if I really had on was a place where you can go directly to get your to go order.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panera-bread-609-3rd-st-davis/2054645,I usually like Panera but the food quality in todays order was poor. And items were missing ruining a meal
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panera-bread-609-3rd-st-davis/2054645,"Restaurant is great, you increasing their prices is not."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panera-bread-609-3rd-st-davis/2054645,"Food is great. Just delivery took longer than expected for a Sunday mid afternoon😕. Time kept being pushed back,  ended up being one hour and 15 mins from order to delivery. It might be traffic but on Sunday? 🤷🏻‍♀️"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panera-bread-609-3rd-st-davis/2054645,Delivery part was great but it's ridiculous that Panera charges over $2 for a tiny little container of cream cheese that's not even enough for both sides of a single bagel.  Will not order again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/panera-bread-609-3rd-st-davis/2054645,They packed the bread right next to the cold water bottle which made the bread soggy

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vegan-deadly-sins-900-15th-st-sacramento/2211476,I was unable to eat the food because the request for utensils was missed (and I checked off the box).  Staying in a local hotel and I don't typically pack utensils in my luggage.  What a bust and lack of service.  Would not use Vegan Deadly Sins or Grubhub customer service assistance because that is a total waste of your time!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/tasty-dumpling-3700-crocker-dr-sacramento/2614841,Food was an hour late. And everything was cold by the time it made it. Had to re-microwave and steam everything to heat and soften things back up to eat it for dinner

Not as bad as some places I've had it before but still overcooked. N the Thai tea was kind of water down

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/i-heart-mac--cheese-1631-k-st-sacramento/7561296,Cheese sauce was bland.  Overall dish tasted okay bit not worth delivery prices.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/i-heart-mac--cheese-1631-k-st-sacramento/7561296,"Very good, second time trying. To be honest, I did feel that the chicken was lower quality than the price point"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/i-heart-mac--cheese-1631-k-st-sacramento/7561296,"The mac and cheese tasted like lately buttered, unseasoned pasta. Maybe it was tossed in something, but no sauce or cheese to be found. 

Ordered vegan grilled cheese and they called to tell me they didn't have vegan cheese slices and wanted to know if I wanted anything else. I asked them to remove the sandwhich but include a slice of toast. They agreed, and there were 2 slices of burnt toast completely saturated in salty butter, but they still charged me for the vegan grilled cheese + veggies I added to the original order. 

Tater tots were unsalvagable. Cooked, refrigerated, microwaved, and cold again. They were SO try and disgusting.  I had high hopes. I'm rooting for them to improve but it'd take a lot for me to try it again."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ming-dynasty-1211-broadway-sacramento/7056768,The food was mid. The bbg meat was old and chewy. The wor wonton broth lacked flavor. The chicken chow mein was oily. I was hoping to find a good Chinese spot but this one could have been better.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,Excellent! Food is amazing.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,The restaurant was good but grubhub service was bad. Food was delayed an hour
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,The food was good. The naan was especially good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,I have had better food from them before.  This was dry and overcooked
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,Thank you for honoring our request to make it child friendly and easy on the chili
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,Delicious. Disappointed because the naan was missing (our favorite) and was over 1 hour late. Had to feed my kids something else
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,Your grubhub delivered came 2 hours late.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,That was not good .. the utensils are broken and all the things fallen in the bag
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,Seriously the best indian restaurant around. I live in davis and order from Dixon rather than receive things sooner and eat the stuff close by.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,It's been a longtime haven't eaten there but today when I ordered food there it was so good. Definitely will order more whenever I will need.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,Delicious food but was spicier than I hoped. I had asked for it to be very mild because I'd be sharing with a toddler

It is amazing and has a ton of flavor, if you love this kind of food. Give it a try, you will be more than pleased. My driver showed way before the scheduled time."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,"The order was an hour late, due to which my guests had to wait very long and hungry. It was way past lunch time. Almost dinner! The food when arrived had spills and the Chicken biryani's box was broken due to which I had to throw it a lot of it off in trash. The bhature were hard like a hardshell taco and were soaked in oil. Which is how they are not supposed to be."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/punjabi-dhaba-7800-batavia-rd-dixon/2194143,Delicious! Getting again!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/journey-to-the-dumpling-2-1700-21st-street-sacramento/8179024,"JttD the restaurant itself was amazing. I had an issue with my delivery and that’s not on them at all. There was a bit of confusion when I got to the restaurant bc I ended up reordering and did a pick up instead to avoid the same issue from before.
When I arrived to JttD, I was hungry and had four people waiting on me with an equal amount of hunger. If I came off too strongly to the young woman at the desk, I apologize. Due to the error of the previous order, it delayed my family and I from eating by an hour and that wasn’t the young woman’s fault.
The food was AMAZING. Big props to the cooks. And a thank you and apology to the young ladies in the front.
Will definitely be going here again. I just might not do a delivery, though."

The staff was super busy during the lunch rush, but the sandwich was still incredibly delicious. I will try it again eventually."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ikes-love--sandwiches-1420-16th-st-ste-100-sacramento/951426,"The sandwiches are always pretty good at Ike’s.  However, it cost over $70 for three sandwiches.  That is AFTER the discount (from the monthly plan that I pay extra for).  That comes to $23.33 per sandwich (after tax and tip, and with the discount).  Also, the veggies and sauce/spread were very sparse, so the sandwiches were dry and hard to swallow.  In addition, I paid for extra yellow mustard on the side, which did not arrive.  I’m not going to be ordering from Ike’s on GrubHub (or Uber Eats) due to the exorbitant prices."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/boba-pho-u-3071-freeport-blvd-sacramento/2680056,"This place does not include any of the standard pho fixins with their bowls—weird choice…but okay, and the owner makes a big deal of saying on Yelp they’ve listened to customer feedback and now include the stuff free of charge—yeah great idea but the delivery service menu does not reflect that. What I have a real problem with is I specifically selected and paid extra for the fixins and did NOT receive them. If this was some super special pho with broth, meat, and noodles so amazing you don’t NEED sprouts, onion, herbs or jalapeño, great—but it’s not. Chicken pho: chicken cooked well but broth flavor meh and noodles like bland stale straw. Beef pho: steak looked good but one note broth mostly tasting of star anise. Ended up throwing out more than half of each as the leftovers didn’t get eaten. Egg roll order is only two rolls which along with everything else just seems chintzy and not good enough for the price. Several better phos in Sacramento so won’t be ordering again."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/everest-curry-1728-broadway-sacramento/8067248,I have had Lamb Coconut curry elsewhere but this one was not worth it at all. The sauce was made with coconut chaff in it. Was too difficult to eat. Had to trash it.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vallejos-restaurant-1900-4th-st-sacramento/7092248,Food good as always but in delivery items were leaking into the bag like it was dropped or overturned en route. Just hoping a little more care on delivery next time.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vallejos-restaurant-1900-4th-st-sacramento/7092248,"Food arrived 35 minutes late and cold. No communication from driver, and they didn't follow directions of knocking on the door to deliver in person. I watched them take the longest possible route to my house from the restaurant. $32 for relatively good but still VERY cold food. Not worth it."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/vallejos-restaurant-1900-4th-st-sacramento/7092248,"Vallejo's is a really good high-end Mexican restaurant with reasonable prices, and it's a really delicious Mexican place and that you make the really traditional refried beans and the rice that tastes 10 times better than anywhere else"

I got ONE green sauce. One. 2 whole breakfast burritos and ONE green sauce. The guacamole is gross and runny, enchilada is too spicy, chips were flavorless and old. Tostada was soggy."

The flavor, portion size…everything just spot on. They read my notes and did exactly what I asked, no other restaurant has done that. 
The carne nachos for $13.50 were amazing, just the flavors… the meat was not overbooked but tasted marinated and juicy. The cheese is real cheese. I could go on and on. 
You will 100% be satisfied! The churros are infilled and exactly as you want. Crispy, sugary, soft inside, and cinnamony"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-2820-del-paso-rd-suite-100-sacramento/2720903,Great food. Slow service.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-2820-del-paso-rd-suite-100-sacramento/2720903,"The calzones were delicious but there was only enough dipping sauce for half of the calzone, so you should order extra. Also the calzones were not labeled when they arrived making us open all of them to check which was which.  The driver was friendly.  Would definitely buy again."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-2820-del-paso-rd-suite-100-sacramento/2720903,Food needs to be at least warm when delivered.

Def he was not worth the $5 tip he got.   Disappointed for being my first grub order.  Never again.

Driver was awesome and waited for them to make our food and then he delivered it. I was disappointed that the restaurant made no attempt to make up for the wait in any way."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-2820-del-paso-rd-suite-100-sacramento/2720903,I really liked the food I had put two different pepperonis and only one type was in it but it's okay it was still very good!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-2820-del-paso-rd-suite-100-sacramento/2720903,"I thought the bread was over cooked & then I realized there was some kind of spicy pepperoni or something & realized they brought the wrong order.
I couldn't eat it, I made an omelette instead.

This was my 1st order here. I didn't care for the crust & even if they made the correct order, I think I wouldn't order from this place again.
They couldn't reach the driver & gave me refund"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-2820-del-paso-rd-suite-100-sacramento/2720903,Never received my food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-2820-del-paso-rd-suite-100-sacramento/2720903,Fantastic calzones!! Only issue I had was that I paid for dipping sauce I didn’t receive. Would have been even better (and five stars) if I’d had that.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-2820-del-paso-rd-suite-100-sacramento/2720903,Very good. We will order again!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,"I am from Tennessee & let me tell you, this stuff is really good."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,The food was pretty good but the coleslaw had a weird taste
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,About an hour after eating just one chicken tender I was violently sick.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,I’m so glad it’s back! Delicious food every time
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Mediocre food for exorbitant prices
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Chicken was good but the photo of 3 tenders showed fries in it so I thought I was getting fries but I guess they aren't included
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,The chicken sandwich was really good. The fries looked amazing and may be great if there wasn't garlic in the seasoning. I wouldn't have ordered the fries if i knew the fries had garlic on them.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,"Grubhub delivery was great. The food not so much. The Mac and cheese was bland and the cheese sauce tasted watery. The chicken itself tasted a day old and microwaved, and the breading was nasty."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Always on time and always delicious and actually spicy! Has become our go-to chicken place.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Not good.  Chicken sandwiches tasted weird. Pickles and Mac and cheese packed any flavor. Do not recommend
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Chicken wings were dry. The chicken sandwiches did not have a lot of flavor. The secret sauce was not spicy. It was overall okay not the worst or the best chicken I have had
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Should have some fries with it for 9 dollars but it’s a good sandwich. The pickles were eh

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,"It's made in a bar, not the actual restaurant if you order on Grubhub. Very odd and a notable taste in quality difference"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Love it good food
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,"The food was great and still hot upon arrival. The chicken tenders were big, nice and spicy but the dry spice was a little weird. The fried pickles were great. So were the crinkle cut fries. The salad was good but I wasn't told what was in it or if I could change it. Didn't want tomatoes. The spiciest option was great for me. Made my nose runny while still keeping its flavor. Would definitely order from here again."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,So good! Got it for the 2nd time and it was delicious :)

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Had high hopes for this place but that was short lived. I ordered the hot chicken sandwich and I was disappointed to find it was not hot at all. No hint of spice at all. Breading is very thin on the chicken but the taste overall was decent.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,LOVE IT!! Food is Delicious!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/sacville-hot-chicken-1630-j-st-sacramento/1945145,Cancelled order twice on two separate afternoons. Why accept the order then cancel 10 minutes later? It isn't like you're about to close.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/broderick-roadhouse-319-6th-st-west-sacramento/7894304,The order was a half an hour late. Then an entire meal (chicken and waffles) was left out. The food I did get was cold and soggy.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/plant-power-fast-food---sacramento-1100-r-street-sacramento/2750973,Tasted like fish. I got my money back. The fries have always tasted good but also always been cold & soggy - which is weird.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/plant-power-fast-food---sacramento-1100-r-street-sacramento/2750973,I asked for no peppers and their peppers and someone wrote on the receipt the salads are premade. I'm allergic to peppers. The order was very late.

Instead it was one that came in a wrapper.  But after tasting it I thought it was actually a good tasting brownie.  The peanut butter shake wasn't as good as I hoped for, I drank about 1/2 of it and put the remainder in the freezer in case I am desperate for something sweet or icecream like. I would order from this place again."

Employee at the register is unwelcoming, waved her hand to get me to go to her without using her words. Felt condescending and came off as rude. Really taken back by that.  Sauce containers in to go order were melted, looked like they threw it on top of the fries when it had oil on it still that may have melted the plastic. Which explains why it tasted like chemicals. Would not be back because I am afraid of the same rude service and laziness"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/plant-power-fast-food---sacramento-1100-r-street-sacramento/2750973,My order cost $91 and was delivered without salad dressing for the salad that was 13$. Lame!!!!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/shahs-halal-food-3000-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/8069432,The driver pulled up with her mother 2 blocks from my house and wouldn’t respond to my calls or texts did not look at instructions to get to my house I had to walk 2 blocks in the cold at night time to meet her for my food and she still tried to argue with me and not give me my food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/shahs-halal-food-3000-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/8069432,Some of the best food I have ever eaten

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/shahs-halal-food-3000-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/8069432,"Shah's is consistently incredible, and I was very excited to see them on Grubhub. Makes figuring out what to eat for lunch at work a much simpler choice. Decided to try the Chicken/Lamb combo over a salad instead of rice and it was fantastic, I usually find salads unsatisfying or overpriced but it was neither. Fries are also top tier, easily. I'd even made a silly mistake on my order and they called me to make sure I got what I actually wanted, THREE times to make sure they got through to me since that's when I figure it's an actual person calling. Food and customer service goes above and beyond. And if you have GH+, the entrees mostly being $13 means you don't have to buy something else to hit the free delivery threshold which quickly increases prices at other places. Shah's will not let you down."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/shahs-halal-food-3000-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/8069432,I was worried a gyro might not be enough food but it was  satisfying. Also had to try a piece of fish and the honey cake. Also fantastic. I'm not usually a fry person and typically just don't eat them or order them but the fries were worth it.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Great service and decent pricing.  My son loves their boba and chicken bowls.  Staff is cheerful and friendly.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"I forgot to change my address but it was all good! Grubhub notified the driver when I reached out for help and the driver texted me promptly to make sure he had the right apartment (thank you Scott!)

The driver even reached out to me after delivering that he noticed one of the Boba drinks had been placed in the bag upside down and told me that I could contact Grubhub if it leaked. Even though nothing leaked or was otherwise amiss, I was very touched by and appreciative of the driver's above and beyond kindness and service (again, thank you Scott!)

The food and drinks were perfect for a hot day like today, especially for someone like me who doesn't have a car and had absolutely zero motivation to cook.

Overall, 11/10! Super happy!

If possible, please pass my gratitude and appreciation to Scott for his stellar performance and amazing service on this hot summer day!"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Funky. Good milk tea. Haven't tried the food yet. Next time.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"I went here specifically for the cool glass cups they give you, but when I got there the lady said they didn't put online orders in glass cups.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"The food is actually pretty decent, but for the first time I didn't get Boba with my green milk tea so that was sad. I've decided to order tapioca pearls online so I can make my own. 

This isn't the only restaurant that didn't put Boba in my tea. 
Teabo café is the worst!  They messed up my orders twice - once I ordered 3 teas with boba and they only delivered one. The other time they didn't put boba in my $7.20 tea but only refunded me $2.60. And they are rude and late with refunds. 

GrubHub customer service chat agents were not very helpful either. Apparently I have to wait up to 10 business days for a refund. 

I will still order from lazy cow because their food is good and this is the first mistake they made.  

But NOT Teabo. (I had to put this review here because I was never offered the chance to review my last two orders with Teabo.)"

The only downside was the poor packaging of one of the items. The way they put the food into the container made it impossible to open the lid without the curry spilling out. Other than that, it was a good experience and I would order from here again!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,❤️ the concept
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,OH MY GOD HORRIBLE FOOD TODAY I COULD NOT EVEN EAT IT!!!!! The ramen was so salty omg the calamari was burned and who the heck makes these terrible smoothies. No flavor at all! Wow horrible!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Grubhub is trash
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"It wasn't the restaurant, it was the delivery guy. He came 20 minutes later than he was supposed to, and didn't even include utensils for us to use (fork, napkin). I'm very disappointed."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,"Placed an order. Received a text saying my order was on the way 45 minutes later. 15 minutes later my food was marked delivered even though  I had no food. Tried calling the number provided only for the phone line to be busy 3 times. Contacted Grubhub support to be asked to wait 10 more minutes. Then contacted them again to be told i'd get a phone call from a manager. 2 hours later, still no food, still no phone call. Great service."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Placed my order at 3:40 it didn't arrive until 5:30. Had to leave at 5. Food is sitting at my door apparently. Will not be using grub hub again. Two hours is ridiculous. The driver took forever. It's my favorite restaraunt in davis. They have really good food. The delivery driver needs to go or there needs to be more grub hub drivers. Two hours is stupid.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-407-g-st-ste-4-davis/1097422,Loved the reusable glass jars and the bubble tea was delicious!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/aces-gyro-shack-1603-10th-st-sacramento/5062904,Great hummus and pitas
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/aces-gyro-shack-1603-10th-st-sacramento/5062904,Chicken shawarma wrap and gyro were identical except for pita vs thin wrap. No hummus on shawarma and way too much tzatziki. Bland chicken. Soggy fries.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/aces-gyro-shack-1603-10th-st-sacramento/5062904,Food is great 👍
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/aces-gyro-shack-1603-10th-st-sacramento/5062904,"The food was really good, the only thing I did not like was the fries were a bit undercooked :("

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pardon-my-cheesesteak-1745-cowell-blvd-davis/6208280,Food is awful. Worst Cheesesteak of my life. I no longer wish to order from Ghost Kitchens after eating from Pardon My Cheesesteak.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pardon-my-cheesesteak-1745-cowell-blvd-davis/6208280,"Food was meh, and took longer than expected to get here."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pardon-my-cheesesteak-1745-cowell-blvd-davis/6208280,"The food was great! The delivery driver massaged me asking for more of a tip and blackmailed me by expanding my delivery time by 30 minutes until i gave him a higher tip. As soon as i raised my tip amount, my delivery time went back down by 30 minutes. The funny thing is that i was automatically going to give a higher tip upon delivery. I don't like tipping people prior to their service. i tip them based on the quality of their service, not because i have to.  After he messaged me (way before his service was completed), i felt pressured to raise the tip amount because i didn't want him messing with my food or anything like that."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pardon-my-cheesesteak-1745-cowell-blvd-davis/6208280,food was good but delivery took long
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,Food is good. Didn't really follow instructions on one of the items but that's only minor problem.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"amazing food, great flavors, still hot when I got the food."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"Food was great , did take long. The issue was with the rude driver, before he even got the order he was at the restaurant waiting and was already asking if I had tipped or not because my order was pricey and he only charges to deliver my order $7. I answered him and said I’d tip at the end I received my food and went inside and as I was going in to the app to tip , I get a text from the driver asking if I’m going to tip or not. I said yes , and as I was on the app trying to adjust the tip, the app crashed and logged me out but only let $3 dollars be tipped , and wouldn’t let me go back and changed it , I told the driver my app crashed and o was trying to fix the tip, he texted back a long message saying it was disrespectful to him that only 3$ tip was given that if it wasn’t for him me nor my family would eat and that he waitied 50min (it wasn’t a 50min wait that’s a lie ) and that he would refund my tip . Drivers before hand know what they are getting tipped and paid for the order they will deliver , he could’ve just left and got another order when he saw it took real long for the restaurant to finish it but no he stayed and wants to blame it that he waited for my order on me. TIP IS OPTIONAL IT STATES IT RIGHT HERE ON THE APP AND I KNOW MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS DEAL WITH RUDE DRIVERS DEMANDING TIPS That is SO UNPROFESSIONAL TO BE TEXTING THE CUSTOMER ASKING IF THEY WILL TIP AND THEN TELLING CUSTOMER OFF FOR THE TIP THEY RECEIVE. Worst ever driver I’ve had he shouldn’t be in this line of work with that attitude."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"The food was so delicious and still hot. We are all feeling under the weather so we ordered soup (vegetable, beef pho, and war wonton) and it was just perfect."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,Will not order from them again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"Was supposed to be a ""priority delivery"" it was not the driver delivered another order previous to my order making my order late and my food cold obviously not a priority."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,Typically good but 1 hour to make the food is unreasonable
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,The bread on the sandwich was dry and stale.  Rolls were all rice and lettuce. Barely any meat or shrimp.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"Tasty food and big portions. Lots of veggies and greens which is nice. Soup broth was still hot and wasn't over salted. Overall, enjoyed the food and experience"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,Very good. Will definitely order from the same restaurant again.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"They provided lots of proteins and noodles, but not enough actual pho. Instead of one small cup of pho, the XL pho should come with 2 or 3 cups of pho. What I received wasn’t soup; it was a noodle dish. It tasted good. I just needed more liquid."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"The sandwiches taste plain, the sour from the carrots was water down. No flavor all I tase is the bread and the meat. Won’t buy again"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,It gave me the delicious pho that I was hoping for.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"There was nothing wrong with the restaurant at all. I repeat nothing wrong with the restaurant. My driver just delivered my food late and by the time I got it, it was cold. I ordered pho because I'm home sick and needed some hot soup like food to help me feel better but that didn't happen."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,One of the better restaurants in the area

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,Food was good but they were missing the shrimp I paid extra for and really wanted
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,I will never order from this restaurant again and if I don't get a full refund I will not be using the Grubhub service again as the service is just as much to blame for the fiasco.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,Food was cold and fried food was soggy and greasy. Portions were not consistent
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,The combination    pho was amazing and brought me back to life
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,He had trouble finding  my  apartment and he put in effort to call me and ask for directions. He was very nice.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,Good portions. Well packaged. Food looks fresh and well prepared.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,"The food was not good and I spent $20 on anything.  I ordered Pho and it was a hard dry no! 
Dry chicken, no radish, lime, cilantro! Smh. Keep moving."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pho-viet-2-1589-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2745130,Delicious! I got the 3 colors drink and the rare steak and brisket pho. Definitely will order again.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cajun-feast-206-3rd-st-davis/2621120,Descriptions of food dishes were not accurate. Baked chicken was two small drumettes and a tiny half thigh. Not worth the money.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bento-box-midtown-1600-k-st-sacramento/6055424,It was good!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bento-box-midtown-1600-k-st-sacramento/6055424,Food was good! Portion was a little smaller than I expected and remember from when I had gone in person in the past.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bento-box-midtown-1600-k-st-sacramento/6055424,The tempura was mostly breading. There were parts with no shrimp at all. I will not order again because this the second time I’ve paid extra for tempura and I just get breading.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bento-box-midtown-1600-k-st-sacramento/6055424,The salad was bad and had several leafs that had black stains on them. I had to throw it away.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bento-box-midtown-1600-k-st-sacramento/6055424,Smoked salmon roll barely had any salmon on it. I could not taste the smoked salmon at all as it was way too tiny.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bento-box-midtown-1600-k-st-sacramento/6055424,Waited like 25 extra minutes. They never updated the status on the order. It was ready long before but I wasn’t notified

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bento-box-midtown-1600-k-st-sacramento/6055424,"Ordered Thai Chicken Rice Bowl. the dish was good but unexpectedly spicy hot  --seemed a lot hotter than normal Thai--menu said spicy Thai marinade, but did NOT say extra hot.   I enjoy spicy hot food but thought this was unusually hot--as if it was special - ordered extra hot.  Would try restaurant again as it was good, just unexpected and I couldn't eat much if it.  My husband ate his and mine--but he usually orders extra extra Thai hot.   on the plus side, it did clear my sinuses."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bento-box-midtown-1600-k-st-sacramento/6055424,"The order came fast and was hot. The driver dropped it off just fine. I was a little shocked that they only gave one tiny little packet of soy sauce. I also ordered enough for two people and they only give one fortune cookie. The biggest disappointment was the pork teriyaki. Because in my mind pork teriyaki is kind of sweet. Well, it was extremely spicy. I've never had spicy Asian food like that before. They really need to say somewhere on the menu that it is spicy. Because I could barely eat it and it made my whole face sweat."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/robertas-cocina-mexican-5635-freeport-blvd-sacramento/1111327,It did not give me any salsa are sour cream and it had to much onion

What I got wasn't chicken. I don't know what it was, but it was spicy and looked more like a red meat. Also, a few pieces of ""chicken"" were like rubber and couldn't be chewed.  My dog didn't even want it."

2. Received very few chips and napkins."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/robertas-cocina-mexican-5635-freeport-blvd-sacramento/1111327,They forgot my side order so I'm out four bucks.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/robertas-cocina-mexican-5635-freeport-blvd-sacramento/1111327,The meat in the Asada Burrito was low quality and had many chunks of gristle and who knows what other animal parts in it. I do not recommend it.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mod-pizza-west-sacramento-771-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/4485632,Pizza was cold and box wet from condensation in bag where it had been held to long.  Shame - it was good pizza
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mod-pizza-west-sacramento-771-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/4485632,Mod pizza is great. The grub hub driver only picked up one of two boxes. The receipt on top of the box said one of two.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mod-pizza-west-sacramento-771-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/4485632,The food arrived cold because the driver somehow went all the way across town and back before they delivered my order. The pizza boxes were smashed and everything was cold.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mod-pizza-west-sacramento-771-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/4485632,Pizza was cold. Courier had trouble picking up and delivering my order because of his walker.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mod-pizza-west-sacramento-771-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/4485632,The driver sat In Natomas for 15 mins then when my food was dropped off it was barely warm. I don’t know if that’s because the restaurant didn’t notify the driver as soon as the food was done or being made
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mod-pizza-west-sacramento-771-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/4485632,"Gluten-free pizza was ordered with white sauce, three meat toppings, and cheese.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mod-pizza-west-sacramento-771-ikea-ct-west-sacramento/4485632,Only second time we've ordered from here but staff always seems great. Just a little disappointed because the pizza was pretty cold by the time we received it.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,No more tonight
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,Just missing hardware and I requested it . I had to find some to eat
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,"Wasn’t as tasty as usual this time. Been eating there for years, and this was the first time I could describe it as “bland.” Also they got an order wrong, sent me pad see yew with chicken, but I’d ordered it with duck. That was disappointing, cause their chicken is dry and bland, whereas their duck is tender and delicious. A lot of great Sacramento restaurants like Bangkok@12, and several Indian ones, have really been going downhill over the past couple years, watering down their sauces, overcooking food, using less or lesser quality seasonings... I don’t know why. I’m not ready to add Chada to that list after just one sub par experience. I’ll give them a couple more chances. Hopefully next time I order from them it’ll be as good as it’s always been."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,"I just wrote a full critique that this site deleted, the food was awful, shamefully bad.  Coupled by the fact that the driver picked up my order and then drove to westlake in deep natomas and then delivered my cold food an hour later. Nothing was edible, an expensive lesson. Which is sad because I have loved this restaurant for years, I might try it again on site, but GrubHub, Picking up the food and delivering it an hour later, ? That is planning to fail, bad food, worse service, I am waiting to see that the follow through is going to be. I am not optimistic!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,"The food was not good. The green curry was watery with very little flavor, except the taste of sugar.  The crab rangoon filling was also sweet and cold."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,"Courier was great but order was incorrect- missing chicken in two of the items which I paid an extra fee for, unfortunately. Food was otherwise hot and delicious."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,"Food was missing, dishes were completely wrong, and meat was added to dishes that were vegetarian. We’ve been eating at Chada Thai for over a decade and will never never eat there again."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,"Order was wrong, was suppose to have green beans but got eggplant? Package is bad, the sauce spill inside the bag. Rice seem old, some spot were hard/burn"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,"Chada is usually delicious. Tonight the peanut sauce was burnt tasting, too spicy, and inedible. And the food arrived So Late."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,Chada is usually very good. However this is the second time where I received chicken in my curry instead of tofu
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,Pad thai had a little curry taste to it I didn't expect.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,"Restaurant is great; the issue of late is Grubhub's inability to keep drivers on time.  Also, they still cancel orders too frequently."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,Love their fried snapper fish and the tamarind sauce. However the to yum soup is so sweet for me. Love their papaya salad. I hope i can go visit this restaurant next time after Covid pandemic.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,consistently delicious and great portion sizes. my only complaint is that ordering through the app didn't offer a way to select protein options for each dish
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,I order tilapia pad thai and it was full of chicken. Too expensive for mistakes like that. Not going back.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chada-thai-cuisine-1624-broadway-sacramento/1451398,My favorite Thai spot in Sacramento for vegan options. Their curry can't be matched. Rolls and soup i ordered this time were also fantastic

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cornerstone-cafe--bar-1617-sacramento-ave-west-sacramento/2793340,Great restaurant and food. Varied menu if home cooking and pub style foods. Good both in store and at home.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cornerstone-cafe--bar-1617-sacramento-ave-west-sacramento/2793340,I asked for no onions on my salad and it came with onions. Other than that food was good.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cornerstone-cafe--bar-1617-sacramento-ave-west-sacramento/2793340,I debated between two and three stars. The burger was under-done but probably the best part of the order despite that. The fries were floppy and tasted old. I had to crisp them up in an air fryer. The french toast was bland and also seemed like it was cooked before I ordered. The ingredients didn't seem bad but the food was poorly prepared.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cornerstone-cafe--bar-1617-sacramento-ave-west-sacramento/2793340,Food is good. Good quality. Nice portions.

He acted like it was our fault. Even tho I waited outside the building for 30mins. and ended up directing him over the phone for 3 blocks. Im sre cornerstone had it packerd neatly as we have ordered from them numerous times but again by the time the driver found us is was less than neat to say the least. This is not a negative for cornerstoner but directed at grubhubs driver. Would have give 1 star just for that BUT WE LOVE CORNERSTONe and ultimatly will be ordering again."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/burger-king-2026-lyndell-terrace-davis/2131972,Food was cold cuz it was late

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Dynamite Roll and Crunchy Roll are the absolute best. Thanks so much.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Love every sushi roll they make. Thanks so much
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Satori Sushi is the best sushi restaurant. So yummy.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Amazing food and punctual delivery
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Excellent driver! He did great.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"It's usually preety good, but the fish doesn't always taste so fresh every time."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"Terrible!  My daughter bragged about them, but it was disappointing. Got order wrong but didn't realize how messed up it was until AFTER I got refund for missing gyoza. They gave two rolls, but they weren't the citrus ones we ordered. Had to throw that out with the ""popcorn chicken "". Was afraid to eat that. All-in-all this was the worse meal I've had in California."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,The driver was courteous and kept me updated on his arrival. The food was packaged neatly and he waited in his car until I opened the door. Well done
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"Restaurant is fine, problem with GrubHub.  Driver picked up order and then drove opposite direction from my house to pick up another order and spent 25+ minutes doing it. Order was delivered to me almost an hour after it was made. Sushi orders need to be delivered quickly and GrubHub put profit over food safety.  Going to cancel my GrubHub account."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"The tempura was ivery disappointing. I ordered it once and thought it was a mistake, but the second time came the same way it basically is fried and batter that you would fry chicken."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"I’m sorry, this sushi was not it. The rice was soggy and there was way too much of it. The tempura was oily. The sauces drizzled on top of the sushi tasted off."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"The food was cold and soggy, I’ve ordered the same items many times before and this is the first time it’s came soggy and cold"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"Dynamite sushi roll and Crunch sushi roll are my absolute favorites, and Satori Sushi are the best. Never had a roll there, I didn't like. Best sushi and so fresh tasting. Thanks for a great Friday night dinner after a long work week."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,forgot sauce for 2 dishes but was good food
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,They didn't get my order correct even though I called and spoke to the restaurant before and after placing the order.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,The food from Satori was amazing. The person delivered was HORRIBLE!!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"The sushi was amazing,definitely will order again"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Excellent food- add soy sauce next time
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"Very disappointed at the preparation of the sushi rolls. All of them were covered by some kind of unidentfied goopy material, very unappetizing. Took a Chance on such a large expensive order, and I lost."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,The only driver who reads the instruction and managed to find the gate and my location. Give me her everytime I order food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Very nice driver
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,First time to order. Loved the sushi and chicken.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,I got extremely sick from the food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Love their food! Not as much variety as most Sushi Restaurants HOWEVER their dishes are always fresh and delicious! The portions are plentiful; enough to share. Thanks!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Great food! Small portions though
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,The spider roll was super delicious I was upset they forgot my dynamite roll but the crazy California was good I'll order again
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,Delivery took much longer than projected and food was soggy and cold by the time it got to me. Also I asked for low sodium soy sauce and was not included.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/satori-sushi-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/2941825,"Good food, good portion, good price."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/the-meltdown-1250-stratford-ave-dixon/4311888,It is the first time I tried it. I will definitely try again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/the-meltdown-1250-stratford-ave-dixon/4311888,The delivery was over an hour late and all the food was room temp. I was offered a $5 credit...as if that made up for it. Never mind.  I won't order through GrubHub or from this restaurant again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/the-meltdown-1250-stratford-ave-dixon/4311888,Food was excellent
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/the-meltdown-1250-stratford-ave-dixon/4311888,"Food was really good and driver was very kind. I was missing a drink, but it was refunded so overall a very pleasant experience!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-1455-ary-ln-dixon/3091206,My order was so late again on the second day. I do not like receiving my meals lukewarm instead of hot. Last night my meal was delivered cold. What's up with the driver's. Do they have a GPS with them. Not a happy camper.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-1455-ary-ln-dixon/3091206,The portion size was laughable for the price we paid. Grubhub nice enough to process refund (though I haven’t sent yet) will not order from pizza guys again
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-1455-ary-ln-dixon/3091206,THE FOOD IS WONDERFULLY GOOD 👍

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/t--z-chinese-restaurant-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/3185117,"The food was good, but...

1. The image associated with the item I ordered is misleading. I thought I was going to get some fried rice and chow mein with my orange chicken. I was a bit surprised and disappointed when I got just orange chicken. A large amount of orange chicken, I will say though.

2. I ordered a wonton soup. It was good but I saved part of it in the fridge to finish later. The next day I found some white mold on top of it, and had to throw it away."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/t--z-chinese-restaurant-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/3185117,The liquid was all over the bag so the food containers could be better. Food was still good.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/t--z-chinese-restaurant-2550-w-el-camino-ave-sacramento/3185117,"First Chinese food I ordered since my move. 
Asked for no onions. There were tons. Sweet and sour chicken was soggy and spongy. Pork fried rice terrible. No flavor except for peas and carrots tasted frozen. Barely cooked. 
I threw chicken away. I recooked the rice myself. 
Terrible first choice in Chinese food."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,"This is my favorite pizza restaurant. However, the last 2 times I've ordered through Grub Hub the deliver did not knock and left my pizza on the ground. I will NEVER ORDER through Grub Hub again!!!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,"Driver gor our order right, but you know what isn't right? The fact that these people have to pay for their own healthcare, out of their own pocket. They deserve better. They deserve a union and the right to organize. It's shameful what the gig economy did to California."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,The pizza crust was almost burnt and by the time I got it it was cold.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,I love their pizza one of my favorites
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,The pizza was 30 min late and cold. If I pay that much for pizza you think they would figure out a way to keep it warm.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,The pizza was cold and the salad warm. I’m not sure what caused the delay. Just an unfortunate incident.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,Food was 15 minutes late and cold

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,Food was cold.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,The food arrived late but probably because it was lunch time.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,"Did not realize how commercial and processed the food from this place was. I didn’t have high expectations to begin with, but I’m honestly not sure if anything I received was real food.  I might have just eaten food made of plastic grown in a lab. Don’t order from here no matter how late or desperate you get. I regret it"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,Wings weren't great.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,"The food was delivered late. It tasted good but arrived cold, and chicken wings were soggy. Gluten-free pizza, although cold, was good."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,"I love Delish and this is the first time they have let me down. I ordered the thick crust this time and it wasn’t cooked well, too doughy to cook thoroughly and it was dry. Order the pizza but avoid the thick crust."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/delish-pizza-2200-16th-st-sacramento/2930067,"I love Delish Pizza! The pizza is hot and exactly how I like it. I normally don't eat the crust, but I do with Delish Pizza. It's the only pizza I eat now."

The Lamb Beef Gyros were filled generously and I added extra Tzatziki Sauce along with tomato and onions. The Rice Pilaf has a unique taste of its own and so very tasty.  OOPS, I ordered TWO Lemon Soup but received only ONE.  Had to split it 😪 😫  DARN !!  Edgar, the driver was timely and placement of order was perfect 👌"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/petra-greek-midtown-1122-16th-st-sacramento/6396672,Consistently great food. Would recommend the chicken platter and baklava if you can snag some!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/petra-greek-midtown-1122-16th-st-sacramento/6396672,"Fries were cold but the restaurant was farther away than I thought.  Giro was stuffed with meat, really good. Saving half for tomorrow. Baklava was good size, a little soggy but tasted good. My homemade is better! Lol."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-800-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/2719996,"Restaurant and driver both forgot one of the meals (a salad), so one of us got to eat and one didn’t.  Grubhub supposedly refunded me right away, but I’ll check when I return from my trip.  My husband liked the calzone.  I’m gluten free, so couldn’t eat any of that."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-800-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/2719996,The calzone had no flavor whatsoever but the crispy texture of the dough was nice. I won’t order again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-800-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/2719996,"I ordered an extra marinara sauce that was an extra charge, but didn't receive the extra sauce. Other than that no problems."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-800-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/2719996,"Missing the salad and one of the canzones was wrong, requested no pesto sauce and it had it on it."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-800-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/2719996,Food was barely warm and took forever to get here
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-800-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/2719996,My GrubHub driver dropped my food off at space 2 instead of 113 and I text and said call me when you get to casa mobile home park if you need to well he never called. I called my driver and he told me where it was. Other than that calzone food is good I like it.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/calzone-life-800-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/2719996,Today not good

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buffalo-pizza--ice-cream-2600-21st-st-sacramento/2031294,The food was not packaged correctly. It was cold wrong ingredients no cheese worst pizza I’ve ever tasted and there was no bag. No nothing just an open box.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buffalo-pizza--ice-cream-2600-21st-st-sacramento/2031294,"The pepperoni pizza was hot & delicious. A great chewy crust, just a little char, tons of pepperoni, a little bit of grease, because it is a greasy meat after all. But not so much as to be off-putting. Lotsa mozzarella, we'd definitely order from here again."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buffalo-pizza--ice-cream-2600-21st-st-sacramento/2031294,Delivery was fine.  Pizza was ok.  We order here fairly often.  This time the ingredients were put on without  care.  Ordered half with olives which apparently meant scattering it in the middle.  Sigh.  It doesn’t take much to put the ingredients on with a bit of thought.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buffalo-pizza--ice-cream-2600-21st-st-sacramento/2031294,"Their pizza is usually great, but this order was awful.  Dry, flavorless. We didn't even finish eating it."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buffalo-pizza--ice-cream-2600-21st-st-sacramento/2031294,Driver left food on the sidewalk in front of my house instead of walking it to the porch.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buffalo-pizza--ice-cream-2600-21st-st-sacramento/2031294,Order was great
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buffalo-pizza--ice-cream-2600-21st-st-sacramento/2031294,"Although we had an issue regarding the drop off address, the driver made efforts to ensure I had my order"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buffalo-pizza--ice-cream-2600-21st-st-sacramento/2031294,"Got the white pizza and the crust was good, although pretty thick. The toppings were oddly flavored. Oh well, I'll keep looking for good pizza in Sacramento."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buddha-belly-burgers-1901-s-st-sacramento/6732616,It's one of my favorite restaurants. I love their food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buddha-belly-burgers-1901-s-st-sacramento/6732616,"Extremely small portions, very overpriced, salad was stale and poorly prepared. Burger was fine, nothing to write home about."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buddha-belly-burgers-1901-s-st-sacramento/6732616,Best vegan food I've ever had
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/buddha-belly-burgers-1901-s-st-sacramento/6732616,One of my new faves in sac. I should probably try some other options though. I’ve gotten the country fried burger 3 times now
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,Good. Just missing sauces for Tonya tacos and mozzarella sticks
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,I can't as wrong order was dropped off
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,"Food was late and extremely cold. Supposed to arrive at 9:22, and got here just before 10. This is the first time a delivery has been like this, very frustrating"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,"Missing my two tacos and sauces. I mean, you spend 30 bucks on some food its kinda rough not having all the sauces for your little fried treats :("

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,Food was cold
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,Homie left my drink in the middle of the street. Food was alright but cold
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,Good but expensive for fast food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,Filled the special order for the large number of items ordered completely correct.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,"Got everything I ordered, but it was lukewarm/cold by the time it arrived. That's fine with me since it saved me from going outside when I did not feel well."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,Either the driver forgets something or the restaurant does and this happens every time
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,I didn't get my drink.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jack-in-the-box-337-g-st-davis/2455132,I never got my onion rings

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,Great as always
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,The pizza lacked some flavor.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,We all like it very much & will order from Woodstock's again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,Amazing food and service!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,The pizza was overcooked and the crust was so hard you cant even bite it.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,I didn't get my food. It went to another restaurant on the east coast
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,They did not have my order on their system
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,Consistent. A little expensive but not too bad.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,They are good but take quite awhile. May just be busy.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,The best Pizza in Davis!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,I’m not sure if the issue was ok Woodstock’s end or Grubhub’s but I paid online with my card but when it was delivered I was told to pay in cash because they never received my order. I didn’t like the way the issue was handled on Woodstock’s wnd because they were adamant I was in the wrong and I had to pay up or cancel my order. Luckily I contacted Grubhub customer service and they sorted out the issue
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,I paid an extra $.90 to get something and they didn't include it. I felt like that ripped me off
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,I want a refund because the order was canceled and we didn't get our food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,Awesome! Delivery was polite and followed directions.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,Asked for no jalapeños on the tater toe and there were jalapeños. App said it was still delivering but didn’t get an alert when it arrived
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,"Long wait times, but good communication and good food."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,The tomato sauce was had too much pepper in it. Plus the crust was nothing to speak of.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,"fast delivery, great service, tasty 'za"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/woodstocks-pizza-davis-238-g-st-davis/559871,Great! A nice experience

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Very good and tasty. A little expensive.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,We love the restaurant...it was the delivery.  Careless so soy sauce emptied into the plastic bag and was all over the food containers
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Driver did not follow directions… was supposed to knock and handoff order… left food outside on greater than 100 degree day
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,It is one of the best sushi restaurants in Sacramento.  The food is high quality and fresh. The atmosphere is very nice .
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,"Amazing food, 10/10"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Never order through GrubHub!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Everything was tasty. Portions were a bit small for the price: wakame salad was $11 for ~1/2 cup. The meat plate with NY steak was rubbery and not worth $30+. The ramen was good and packaged separately to preserve texture. The tempura also had a good texture despite being in styrofoam clamshells.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Great as usual

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Food tasted okay but the tempura order was so tiny. Usually you get 7-8 pieces of tempura veggies but this came with only 5 and the batter was not a good texture. Felt 'dry'..
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Forgot the ginger and wasabi
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Yummy food! The vegetable sushi is delicious with apple in it! Definitely recommend!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Not very tasty

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,They forgot one of my rolls however the rolls were so good and so big it turned out we didn't even need it so it worked out. Recommend.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,1st time ordering. Will do it again soon.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,Everything was great!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ju-hachi-1730-s-st-sacramento/1718518,"I ordered a Bento box and selected raw tuna as one item.  They called me to ask what I meant by that. They gave me overdone salmon and overdone ""seared"" tuna.  The salad was grated cabbage with a few spinach leaves on top."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,🙂👍🏼Delivery was quick too
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Restaurant did their best but the Grub Hub app was very unhelpful
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"The restaurant itself is fine, but the grubhub order didn't arrive on time to align with the pizza restaurant's orders. Further, the messaging from grubhub didn't fully translate to the restaurant, resulting in a very long wait (an hour and 10 minutes for pizza!), and errors in the order."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"Always nice, clean and have my order ready on time. Never had a bad experience with them."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Very good. Want to use one more times.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Food arrived over an hour late and order was incorrect.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"The customer service is pretty good, however; the food is awful and the restaurant didn't get the order right.  What was delivered was not good at all."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Delivery was one and a half hours long. Paid for 4 ranch dips received only 2.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,messed up my order
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"Didn’t get the right order, then the replacement was late and left at my door at 1 am."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"Order was correct and food was ready on time, stayed hot even by the time I got home. Highly recommend 👍🏼"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,The food tastef old and was cold
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Order sent to wrong address. Did not check grubhub delivery address
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Really enjoyed it. Great experience.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"I love this pizza guys. They got my order correct but the deliverer delivered it across the street. Those residents then brought it to residents in the front house (where I do not live) but is at my address. The neighbors contacted me and I got it from them. But given corona that was a lot of needless and dangerous contact . Had my inputted address and delivery instructions been followed this would not have happened. But also these are stressful times, the driver may have had alot going on, we're allnjust tryna survive. If you could just encourage folks to read address and most importantly delivery instructions that would be great."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Waited 2 hours to receive the wrong pizza and to then be left on hold by the staff. Boneless wings are the same as frozen wings you get at a grocery store. Pizza is less than average.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,The pizza is really good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,If they could give u the right order would be much better
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"First time trying it, it's pretty nice so far"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Food is okay.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Restaurant is fine. Need to communicate better between grupon and restaurant
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Pizza way too salty
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Delivery guy was really nice!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"They are preparing me the wrong pizza. I ordered the signature pizza with extra pepper, they gave me the cheese pizza with pepper"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"Good pizza, thin crust"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Thin crust pepperoni pizza here is solid. The spinach salads are anemic. 1.5 cups of spinach is just not enough food for $7 no matter the toppings.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"First, they did not put in my order. So I waited an hour when it said my order should be delivered to call. I called and the guy offered to give me an extra soda or ice-cream. I picked soda and when the food arrived, they didn’t bring me the extra drink as promised. The pizza I received was super sloppy and not very tasty and the hot wings I ordered had so spice or flavor. I spent $30 for a late subpar meal. I do not recommend this pizza place."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Way faster than expected. We ordered and the food arrived instantly.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"Everything was just bad versions of the food. The potatoes were gross, the wings had almost no sauce and the salad was completely average. Did not order pizza so maybe this is on me."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,The delivery person was super nice and understanding! Really patient as well!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,It's a typical pizza place
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,I think it's okay
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,It was good but the toppings were not as good as expected.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,"Friendly delivery, smiles count"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-505-l-st-davis/313258,Late order and missing items. Expect to wait over an hour for cold food.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/hefty-burgers-1640-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/5776512,The food here is usually good and prepared correctly. But tonight it came cold and my medium rare burger was medium well
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/hefty-burgers-1640-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/5776512,"Tasty food, fast delivery. Great customer experience!"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/hefty-burgers-1640-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/5776512,Speedy delivery and great food!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/hefty-burgers-1640-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/5776512,Drive dumped food at front door and ran off. I usually Add to tip if Driver can perform all instructions as stated in my profile. This guy FLUNKED NOG TIME - NO ECTRA $$
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/hefty-burgers-1640-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/5776512,"The food is usually good, but this order was cold. Fries were not salted or seasoned.Falafel was nothing like so had there before."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/hefty-burgers-1640-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/5776512,Order was wrong and food was cold and gross this time.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/hefty-burgers-1640-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/5776512,"This was a really annoying experience. I ordered the food to have something quick to eat after grinding my homework. I made sure my address was correct and that I gave a very detailed way of easily getting the driver to my apartment. I got the notification that my food came and when I checked outside my door, it wasn’t there. I looked at the reference picture, and the driver had dropped it off at the main office building of my apartment, over 700 feet away from my apartment. I had to leave my place just to get my food, and it was cold by the time I got it. On top of that, the food was not good. The damp cold fries had little seasoning, and my burger was cooked well done when I asked for medium rare and there was no pastrami on the burger and I have pictures to prove it. I paid a lot of money for the fries and burger just to not even be given what I ordered. I am very dissatisfied by this delivery and would not order from this place again."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/hefty-burgers-1640-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/5776512,I ordered my burger medium with no onions. It came well-done with onions. It was hard to chew. The fries and jalapeño poppers were greasy and tasted of old grease.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wienerschnitzel-2961-advantage-way-sacramento/3304630,Driver does not follow directions!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wienerschnitzel-2961-advantage-way-sacramento/3304630,Even though this place is just down the street a few blocks from me it seems that the corn dogs are always luke warm when they show up. The burger is always a nice temperature and super tasty.  Just wish the corn dogs were hotter
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wienerschnitzel-2961-advantage-way-sacramento/3304630,Food was late and semi cold when it did arrive
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wienerschnitzel-2961-advantage-way-sacramento/3304630,I always have the driver knock and hand it to me I am in a wheelchair and cannot get a bag off the ground without help! My door was o an inch and I yelled I’m coming please wait. I was maybe a foot away from the door but had to turn my chair on to move. He did not wait and took off. I had to yell CNN out for help!!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/wienerschnitzel-2961-advantage-way-sacramento/3304630,"He didn't ring door bell like I asked, I wasn't listening to phone & didn't know it was at door on the ground

The hamburger bun was kinda dry"

 Disgusting"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Driver needs to realize he's delivering FOOD!!! Do place it on the ground when there is a TABLE 2 feet away at the front door!!!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Rainbow roll didn’t taste fresh and sauce for potstickers was SO salty.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Food was honestly very mid and had nothing interesting going on.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,"Not impressed, but even more irritated that with how much sushi we ordered, we only got 4 packets of soy sauce and 1 partially full tiny container of ginger. We also asked for 3 sides of ponzu sauce which they failed to include. Our order was late because they didn’t start making it until the driver showed up which we didn’t mind, but the least they could do was give us an appropriate amount of soy sauce, ginger, and include the ponzu sauce we requested."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Restaurant is good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Tasty as usual!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Very small pieces... very stingy with the fish
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,"Restaurant was good. My soup was spilled in the bag, though"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,"Food was so so, unfortunately yhe driver didn't follow the directions in the account notes so I was unaware my order had been delivered. By the time I received the text that the order was delivered my food was cold (tempura vegetables) and it doesn't taste good reheated. The restaurant did their job and their food is ALWAYS good, it's just this time the driver didn't follow instructions."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,The food was disgusting upon arrival.  I'm not sure how it got 4.5 on Grubhub.  Maybe it was a bad night and they weee busy so I'll probably give them another chance.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Great sushi! Wished it was marked as ready for pickup when it's ready though!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,"Raku Sushi did a great job!

Unfortunately the Delivery driver was extremely rude, used the ""F"" word and called me a ""C"" word because I asked why he didn't follow the directions I gave because I'm disabled. Unbelievable. Should be trained on how to better communicate and understand why people leave delivery instructions"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Portion size of sushi is not worth the price. I don't recommend this restaurant.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,"Not the worst sushi I’ve ever had, but definitely nowhere close to the best. Tasted okay I guess, but looked pretty bad; the rolls were wonky and the sauce and masago unevenly distributed. Had it been really good sushi, I’d say it was fairly priced—even on the cheap end—but for what it was, I’d say it wasn’t worth the money. Wouldn’t recommend :/"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Delicious food great service
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,Very friendly staff. The food was ready early despite the restaurant being full. I had a variety of rolls and every roll was independently delicious. Highly recommend.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/raku-sushi-805-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/1039990,We asked for extra soy and teriyaki sauce and NO Sesame seeds. We got no extra sauces and we got sesame seeds

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,I ordered French dip at the restaurant a while ago. It was the best French dip I've ever had. This was every bit as good.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,Best place for upscale pub grub!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,Restaurant was good. Delivery from Grubhub was not. Driver didn't read the instructions. Dropped off my food at the wrong door from my previous hotel stay
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,I've ordered from them 3 times recently and the order has been wrong every time.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,Absolutely LOVE it!!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,"Food delivery usually requires compromise in customer expectation. Not today. This experience deserves praise. The food arrived quickly, hot and expertly packaged by Cafeteria 15L. In such a way that each item retained its flavor and texture. I was impressed with the portion size. The Snack Pack is one of the highest quality, best values I’ve ever seen. Sliders (soft and delicious), tots  (crispy! Hot) and chicken strips (a meal in themselves). We also shared the chicken and waffle (easily two meals by itself) which featured warm waffles, soft and perfect with two giant chicken breasts with a crispy skin and large cups of pecan butter and syrup. Divine. Restored my faith in food delivery and will be ordering from this place again."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,Great food; will definitely go again!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,"The driver delivered it to the wrong door, clearly indicating they did not read the directions. Additionally, they did not contact me that they delivered it so the ice cream was melted. This is not acceptable."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,They forgot the hot fudge that goes with the dessert.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,"The food delivery went fine, but the pasta was dry on the edges as if it had been sitting around awhile. The dessert was melted, which after being in a car for 15 minutes shouldn’t have made it completely liquid. The food order was at 5:04 pm, I did not receive my order until almost 6:45… it was only after I texted the driver that he said he just picked it up."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/cafeteria15l-1116-15th-st-sacramento/2169526,Chicken sandwich was nasty and smelled like fish. The meat was a grayish not natural looking color. Threw away most of it due to taste and scared it was bad.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chitas-taqueria-2019-q-st-sacramento/5591720,"My food was not ready when it was supposed to be. I ordered ahead cuz I had a movie to see. The girl told me it would be a few minutes. After 10 min standing there waiting, I asked how much longer. That's when I found out they lost my order. I could've been standing there till Doomsday. It was a simple bean & cheese burrito, that's all. I finally got it after 35 min when I ordered, they hurried up & made it. It was barely warm. Not a good experience. Plus there's no parking for pickup."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,"One negative, the picture of the driver is scary, he had a ski mask on so you can only see his eyes. Then it was someone else that delivered the food, it was a woman. I will attach a picture if I’m able to. I almost canceled my order but my husband said not to, if he wasn’t home I absolutely would have."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Restaurant always good. Driver left food on ground and my instructions say not to do so
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Gotta have the carnitas tacos every time. Best in town.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,The meat was old and dry lots of missing ingredients and the burrito bowls were soupy
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Good but doesn't provide salsa when requested
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Best flautas I have found!!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Very good food
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,The food is always good but if a burrito isn’t wrapped tight enough it’s just a slop fest. Had to transfer it all to a bowl and ate it with a fork.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,"Clearly states extra charges for selecting proteins. It's able to select multiple proteins, but the overall charges does not change so customers can get confused by either half portions of two choices"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Great but the app said it was still being prepared but my food was already ready

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,I wish the driver would have rang my doorbell as directed. Food was sitting in the rain outside cuz I didn't know it had been delivered.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Very overpriced for what was received

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,My favorite Mexican food!
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Ordered a soda that never arrived.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,It was good
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,It's good.  Usually comes with an ingredient that I asked to not have but this time it was correct.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,The spinach taco was not tasty. Mushrooms were so large and did not taste washed.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,They delayed for order twice and my order got to me an hour later. My churro was undercooked and the tacos were cold and at that point didn't taste good.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,I literally put SPECIFIC instructions to avoid getting SOGGY fries. how hard is it to read??????? My plate was nearly falling apart because it’s PAPER. Common sense isn’t so common I guess
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,"Chandos forgot a chicken taco and side of chips and salsa. Also got delivered to the wrong address, not sure if that was a glitch but I did enter my address. Food was cold and soggy by the time I walked over to pick it up from my neighbor."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chandos-tacos-2530-boatman-ave-west-sacramento/2644614,Driver was very professional and courteous.

There was a thin sheet of paper at the bottom of my food as well and because it had been soaked, the paper easily tore and mixed in with my food. Every other bite had paper in it."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mortons-the-steakhouse-621-capitol-mall-sacramento/2046209,"Food was good but they did not include the dessert I purchased.  Steak was cooked well and packaging was great.  Brussels were some of the best I've ever had (if you like bacon), and the Mac and cheese was top notch.  No utensils as requested."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mortons-the-steakhouse-621-capitol-mall-sacramento/2046209,The food was delivered on its side with the jus leaking out & making the bottom of the bag wet.  The Oscar add on was a big disappointment - quantity & quality.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mortons-the-steakhouse-621-capitol-mall-sacramento/2046209,"Steaks were undercooked and order was about an hour late.  Food was good, but certainly not worth $250.  Not even half that."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mortons-the-steakhouse-621-capitol-mall-sacramento/2046209,Fries soggy but edible. Pork chop was great. Good enough considering this meal probably would have been 100% better eaten at the restaurant.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/mortons-the-steakhouse-621-capitol-mall-sacramento/2046209,The restaurant is great. It was just a bummer to have the food come over a half hour early because I was out and had to run back and by then the food was colder than if it had arrived on time
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/il-fornaio--sacramento-400-capitol-mall-sacramento/4021072,The food was received an hour after the receipt on box and I'm about 5 miles away. Pizza was completely cold when it was received..

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/il-fornaio--sacramento-400-capitol-mall-sacramento/4021072,"The food is terrible, and the portions are so small! Seriously though, overpriced, under-seasoned, mediocre food."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/il-fornaio--sacramento-400-capitol-mall-sacramento/4021072,Food was delicious until I put a bite of the lasagna in my mouth and found a little metal ball and some plastic. Not worth it

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/nenas-mexican-cuisine-232-jibboom-st-sacramento/7949576,1st time was the best. Last time soup was different and not that good. This time they forgot the bacon on a chicken bacon sandwich.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/nenas-mexican-cuisine-232-jibboom-st-sacramento/7949576,Nena’s forgot the tortillas.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/nenas-mexican-cuisine-232-jibboom-st-sacramento/7949576,The restaurant is good. It's GrubHub service that sucks.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,The guacamole delivered was Brown throughout. The driver left my food on the ground instead of ringing the doorbell and handing it to me.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,It's one of my favorite
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,"The last time i had the nachos they were fabulous. Tasted just like a ground beef taco. Today’s nachos tasted bland and old.
The churros have been good in the past but these tasted like the oil has gone bad. Instantly made me sick. I’m disappointed and my stomach hurts. I hope it was just an off night at this location."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,The cheese sauce was really salty
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,Taking one star away because I asked for utensils and they did not send any
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,"Yes, they forgot utensils etc. but otherwise very good food."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,You know how when chicken sits in a warmer with much liquid and the top of the meat gets hard/overcooked well that was how all my chicken was in my bowl. And very liquidy which made the rice super wet. Worse Jimboy’s experience ever. And I’m usually happy with them. Very disappointing.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,My only complaint about this facility is that they are very stingy with their sides of salsa. We either never receive salsa with our order or they give us 3 packets for a large order for 3 people.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/jimboys-tacos-350-750-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/7687664,The food was almost 2 hours late. The food had hair in it. The food was cold. It was awful. I still have it.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/creamys-by-cayla-jordan-1610-r-st-sacramento/2730398,Order was wrong
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/creamys-by-cayla-jordan-1610-r-st-sacramento/2730398,My order was not ready when I arrived which I did not expect. They did not have one of the items that I ordered which I did not find out until I came to pick up my order. I would have liked to have a phone call ahead of time letting me know that my order would not be completely filled. I was then told that preordering doesn’t guarantee the options that I select and was suggested to just call the day of to find out the selection of desserts available. The young lady at the counter helped to  clarify things for me which really helped and she went above and beyond her service which is why I would continue to order from them despite the miscommunication. But they truly still are the best mini cheesecakes around sacramento. I truly do adore them. They are the bomb dot com!

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/pizza-guys-800-harbor-blvd-west-sacramento/2717800,It said specifically not only to knock on the door but to hand it to me the pizza was lukewarm we had to eat it up and as I called the restaurant they told me the driver had picked it Up and sat in the parking lot for a bit. So you can imagine how that made me feel as a pretty loyal customer.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/manchurian-indian--nepalese-cuisine-767-ikea-ct-ste100-west-sacramento/5824728,"The food was not as good as I had hoped. The chai was so strong and had no sugar.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chicken-n-waffles-2961-advantage-way-sacramento/546710,I doubt it’s the restaurants fault but how the orders show up and translate through grubhub. Never had issues ordering directly but the one time I used grubhub my food came completely wrong. No sauce and the wrong extra sauce packets included and the amount of food was half the amount you would normally get.

Upon asking, he told me there were some issues going on and grubhub and other food services receipt weren't printing out. I waited half an hour extra to get my food out and after leaving, I found out my order wasn't compete. I went back and had them correct my order. So, not a pleasant experience for the first time user. Not sure if I'll be using Grubhub again since I won't have any guarantee that my order went thru or not."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/chicken-n-waffles-2961-advantage-way-sacramento/546710,"I specifically asked for certain condiments, none of which I received. I asked for white toast, but received wheat. No syrup for my waffles, no Tabasco sauce and grape jelly. Quite honestly I'm going to consider not using your services any longer. Without fail, nearly every time I use it, there is something missing from my order. In concept this is a great service, but if your employees can't be held to a higher standard, eventually they (employees) will be the reason Grub Hub will not reach it's full potential."

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ume-tea-1411-w-covell-blvd-davis/6352024,"Less sugar is too sweet to me because the sweetness stacked at the bottom of the cup, and the bottom part was very sweet. But overall the drink and snack were good."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/ume-tea-1411-w-covell-blvd-davis/6352024,The driver delivered someone else’s delivery to me. The food is good overall all. I may buy again but hope the driver will be more careful in delivering.

I can’t forgive the funnel cake, it was “deconstructed” aka a bunch of small pieces that all had black dots on them meaning it was probably fried in old grease that they used to fry all their foods in. It was so bad that stopped after like 5 pieces because my stomach started to hurt. The hot dog was plain unlike the picture they advertised had a bunch of toppings and the delivery driver left my food on the thin railing when it was windy, which easily could of fallen from the second floor. So disappointed"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/lazi-cow-2820-del-paso-road-sacramento/7866448,French fries and gator tos were not good- one was spicy and one was garlic. Potstickers were good. Egg rolls just ok. Sauce for them was good.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/papa-murphys-1288-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/6659912,"While the driver did ring the doorbell as requested, he wanted to set the food on the ground even though I asked for it to be hand-delivered. Also, he picked up another order before delivery. I would prefer, even if I have to pay an extra fee(much like Door Dash finally initiated after many complaints, I’m sure), that my order is delivered directly after pick-up. This seems to be a growing trend on Grubhub."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/papa-murphys-1288-w-capitol-ave-west-sacramento/6659912,Order was left at wrong address.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,"Lowkey, hella expensive for the portion. The ice cream was rlly good but the brownie was soooo small for $15, def not worth the price"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,"The food was good but since the ordered items were not in stock, they altered a quarter of our order without notifying me. It was disappointing not getting the items we specifically ordered."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,In the past it has been good.  Last night it was not.  It was delivered with no notification to let me know.  Cookies were cold. Sugar cookie tasted bad and the brownie tasted burnt.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,I love them I just didn't get the cookies I wanted. I won't give them a hard time because it was near closing

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,"More than an hour late,  which means I went to sleep and woke up to melted ice cream on the front porch.  
Just the worst experience"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,"Good was delicious. Sucked it was an hour late. I would have liked a message that told me if it would be late or on time. Additionally, some options weren't available which the online menu should account for as quickly as possible."
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,It arrived late and ice cream melted.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,Delivery was one hour late and cookies were cool and floppy. This is 3 rd or 4th experience like this with grubhub. Will not use grubhub again.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,I didn't get what I ordered and it came 2 hours after it was suppose to be here (not when I ordered it). Didn't even eat them. I called insomnia after it was suppose to be here and they came a whole hour after. Can I get a refund?
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,"My order was extremely late, but the customer service was pretty good"

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,Came two hours and a half hours late and never got a notification. Yesterday i ordered and it was 3 hours late so i guess thats an improvement
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,My son received a text confirmation for the order I placed. He waited at least 30 minutes after the assigned delivery time before calling to inquire about his order since it was late. He was told the Davis location did not make the cookies we ordered (even though we ordered them previously). I was charged for the 6 cookies and 3 milk that were never delivered. It would have been nice to receive a text that they would not be able to fulfill our order. I hope I receive the promised refund.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/insomnia-cookies-202-e-st-davis/1947048,They were late

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/rare-tea-2550-west-el-camino-avenue-ste-13-sacramento/2941319,"Cup size smaller. Tastes like sugar water, not mango. We waited a while after this was frequently happening, and not impressed"
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/rare-tea-2550-west-el-camino-avenue-ste-13-sacramento/2941319,"Their boba was too sweet even for their lowest sugar option compared to other boba places.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bros-liquor-1046-olive-dr-davis/2249579,Why would you substitute white wine for red? There were other Pinot noirs. I discovered my order was changed at my doorstep.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/bros-liquor-1046-olive-dr-davis/2249579,Very wide selection at a reasonable price. I usually use drizzly for my alcohol orders but this place has a lot more to choose from and is generally cheaper.

https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/salt--straw-ice-blocks-1710-r-st-sacramento/4654080,Delicious and special
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/salt--straw-ice-blocks-1710-r-st-sacramento/4654080,The restaurant is great. The driver took a weird detour which was confusing.
https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/salt--straw-ice-blocks-1710-r-st-sacramento/4654080,"This review is strictly for Salt &Straw. The delivery was perfect.

The descriptions were definitely very enticing and I expected incredible bursts of flavor for $14 a pint.  I must not have a refined, gourmet palate as all of you do, but I'll stick to Baskin Robbins. I like my desserts to taste like dessert, not an additional side dish. The snickerdoodle was mildly cinnamon-y and the cookies seemed to be undercooked. The strawberry tastes like olive oil - which would be fine if I was eating a salad."
