"Not recommended for mobile orders. This restaurant will not contact you if they are out of items, and their substitution choices are terrible. I ordered the 2 combo basket, birthday cake slice, and strawberry shake. The shake was immediately refunded with no explanation - I'll assume they were out. Now, when I think of birthday cake, I think funfetti. I received chocolate cake, which I can see is a separate item on the menu. I don't eat chocolate, so this went in the trash. Then to the combo - the proteins (wings and catfish with lemon dust) were great. The sides, tho... Okra was good, but the Mac and cheese was inedible (wtf kind of cheese is that??), and the coleslaw is mid. If I had been counting on that cake and shake, my night would've been ruined.

Even though nothing leaked or was otherwise amiss, I was very touched by and appreciative of the driver's above and beyond kindness and service (again, thank you Scott!)

The food and drinks were perfect for a hot day like today, especially for someone like me who doesn't have a car and had absolutely zero motivation to cook.

Teabo café is the worst!  They messed up my orders twice - once I ordered 3 teas with boba and they only delivered one. The other time they didn't put boba in my $7.20 tea but only refunded me $2.60. And they are rude and late with refunds. 

GrubHub customer service chat agents were not very helpful either. Apparently I have to wait up to 10 business days for a refund.

Not close to what I expected after seeing such a long line and so many beautiful cakes. I wish I had just gone straight home instead.

"Food excellent, as always, however one area of improvement that's needed is order details.  For example, a coworker and I ordered the same item, but one of us ordered spicy and the other ordered no spice.  We received the items, but neither are marked,  and the receipt stapled to the bag of food does not show that one was supposed to by spicy and the other not spicy.   

I don't know if this is a problem or communication from GrubHub to the restaurant or if the 
restaurant's system is unable to capture order details,  or if we're dealing with a worker at the restaurant that ignored order details.  Overall, not a huge deal, but hopefully it's something that Thai Canteen will look into.",Positive,0.8924

"Pumpkin curry was the best- full of pumpkin pieces and chef did not skimp on chicken and shrimps. My only complaint was the Papaya salad and Fried Calamari appetizer. Salad was very bland and had no spice level to it.  I usually like crushed peanuts in salad, but this one had none.  The flavor was sweeter rather than spicy and tangy as it was described on menu. The calamari was a bit chewy, and the batter wasn't even salted. How come the restaurant assumes you will dip in sweet chili sauce, but I like eating mine without sauce, so batter should at least be salted and flavored? At best, it is mediocre Thai food.

When I arrived to JttD, I was hungry and had four people waiting on me with an equal amount of hunger. If I came off too strongly to the young woman at the desk, I apologize. Due to the error of the previous order, it delayed my family and I from eating by an hour and that wasn’t the young woman’s fault.

What I have a real problem with is I specifically selected and paid extra for the fixins and did NOT receive them. If this was some super special pho with broth, meat, and noodles so amazing you don’t NEED sprouts, onion, herbs or jalapeño, great—but it’s not. Chicken pho: chicken cooked well but broth flavor meh and noodles like bland stale straw. Beef pho: steak looked good but one note broth mostly tasting of star anise. Ended up throwing out more than half of each as the leftovers didn’t get eaten. Egg roll order is only two rolls which along with everything else just seems chintzy and not good enough for the price.

Decided to try the Chicken/Lamb combo over a salad instead of rice and it was fantastic, I usually find salads unsatisfying or overpriced but it was neither. Fries are also top tier, easily. I'd even made a silly mistake on my order and they called me to make sure I got what I actually wanted, THREE times to make sure they got through to me since that's when I figure it's an actual person calling. Food and customer service goes above and beyond. And if you have GH+, the entrees mostly being $13 means you don't have to buy something else to hit the free delivery threshold which quickly increases prices at other places. Shah's will not let you down.",Positive,0.9288

As soon as i raised my tip amount, my delivery time went back down by 30 minutes. The funny thing is that i was automatically going to give a higher tip upon delivery. I don't like tipping people prior to their service. i tip them based on the quality of their service, not because i have to.

"Food was great , did take long. The issue was with the rude driver, before he even got the order he was at the restaurant waiting and was already asking if I had tipped or not because my order was pricey and he only charges to deliver my order $7. I answered him and said I’d tip at the end I received my food and went inside and as I was going in to the app to tip , I get a text from the driver asking if I’m going to tip or not. I said yes , and as I was on the app trying to adjust the tip, the app crashed and logged me out but only let $3 dollars be tipped , and wouldn’t let me go back and changed it , I told the driver my app crashed and o was trying to fix the tip, he texted back a long message saying it was disrespectful to him that only 3$ tip was given that if it wasn’t for him me nor my family would eat and that he waitied 50min (it wasn’t a 50min wait that’s a lie ) and that he would refund my tip . Drivers before hand know what they are getting tipped and paid for the order they will deliver , he could’ve just left and got another order when he saw it took real long for the restaurant to finish it but no he stayed and wants to blame it that he waited for my order on me. TIP IS OPTIONAL IT STATES IT RIGHT HERE ON THE APP AND I KNOW MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS DEAL WITH RUDE DRIVERS DEMANDING TIPS That is SO UNPROFESSIONAL TO BE TEXTING THE CUSTOMER ASKING IF THEY WILL TIP AND THEN TELLING CUSTOMER OFF FOR THE TIP THEY RECEIVE.

That was disappointing, cause their chicken is dry and bland, whereas their duck is tender and delicious. A lot of great Sacramento restaurants like Bangkok@12, and several Indian ones, have really been going downhill over the past couple years, watering down their sauces, overcooking food, using less or lesser quality seasonings... I don’t know why. I’m not ready to add Chada to that list after just one sub par experience. I’ll give them a couple more chances. Hopefully next time I order from them it’ll be as good as it’s always been.",Positive,0.7711

The damp cold fries had little seasoning, and my burger was cooked well done when I asked for medium rare and there was no pastrami on the burger and I have pictures to prove it.

"Food delivery usually requires compromise in customer expectation. Not today. This experience deserves praise. The food arrived quickly, hot and expertly packaged by Cafeteria 15L. In such a way that each item retained its flavor and texture. I was impressed with the portion size. The Snack Pack is one of the highest quality, best values I’ve ever seen. Sliders (soft and delicious), tots  (crispy! Hot) and chicken strips (a meal in themselves). We also shared the chicken and waffle (easily two meals by itself) which featured warm waffles, soft and perfect with two giant chicken breasts with a crispy skin and large cups of pecan butter and syrup.

"Even if I could forgive that they ran out of 1 of the only 3 dishes they offer. I can’t forgive the funnel cake, it was “deconstructed” aka a bunch of small pieces that all had black dots on them meaning it was probably fried in old grease that they used to fry all their foods in. It was so bad that stopped after like 5 pieces because my stomach started to hurt. The hot dog was plain unlike the picture they advertised had a bunch of toppings and the delivery driver left my food on the thin railing when it was windy, which easily could of fallen from the second floor. So disappointed",Negative,-0.7487

"While the driver did ring the doorbell as requested, he wanted to set the food on the ground even though I asked for it to be hand-delivered. Also, he picked up another order before delivery. I would prefer, even if I have to pay an extra fee(much like Door Dash finally initiated after many complaints, I’m sure), that my order is delivered directly after pick-up. This seems to be a growing trend on Grubhub.",Positive,0.4404

My son received a text confirmation for the order I placed. He waited at least 30 minutes after the assigned delivery time before calling to inquire about his order since it was late. He was told the Davis location did not make the cookies we ordered (even though we ordered them previously). I was charged for the 6 cookies and 3 milk that were never delivered. It would have been nice to receive a text that they would not be able to fulfill our order. I hope I receive the promised refund.,Positive,0.6331
